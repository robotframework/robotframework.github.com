a keyword is ran within a teardown (case or suite) all operations inside a TRY block are executed even if there is an exception.\r\n\r\nConsidering this sample keyword:\r\n```\r\nMy Keyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${condition}\r\n\r\n    TRY\r\n        IF    $condition     Fail    failing text\r\n        Do Operation\r\n    EXCEPT      AS    ${exception}\r\n        Fail      ${exception}\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it's called within a normal context (case) and the condition is met, `Do Operation` will not be executed; but if it's in a teardown, `Do Operation` is still ran.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is inline with the expectations set with teardowns - that all calls inside them (and inner for called keywords) are executed, in attempt to clean up the environment.\r\n  \r\nStill I'd like to nominate the TRY/EXCEPT blocks for different behavior - when there's an exception in a TRY to halt further calls and fall back to the EXCEPT and FINALLY calls. This will allow the usage of exception handling as normal flow control (like in python), and clear workarounds like the one below.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I'm normally using is to have bogus `RETURN` statements (or huge embedded IF blocks); for instance in the same example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMy Keyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${condition}\r\n\r\n    IF   $condition     \r\n        Fail    failing text\r\n        RETURN     # just so the next lines are not executed in teardown\r\n    END\r\n    Do Operation\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a couple of checks that's ok, but when there are more failure conditions (esp later in the flow - like depending on storage data), this gets ugly:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    IF   $condition     \r\n        Fail    failing text\r\n        RETURN     # just so the next lines are not executed in teardown\r\n    END\r\n    ${check}=     Do Check In SQL\r\n    IF   not $check     \r\n        Fail    check failed\r\n        RETURN     # just so the next lines are not executed in teardown\r\n    END\r\n    # etc\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4987/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4987/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914","id":1963840069,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ851DdJF","number":4914,"title":"Enhance token types used by parsing model","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":20,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T16:09:30Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-10-26T15:34:56Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T15:34:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"On the lowest level the parsing model consists of tokens having different types. For most parts types are fine, but we have identified few issues with them. We should go them through and do at least the following:\r\n\r\n1. When assigning variables, we sometimes use the type `VARIABLE` and sometimes `ASSIGN`. Issue  #4708 proposed changing the type used with FOR and EXCEPT AS variables from `VARIABLE` to `ASSIGN` to be consistent with variables created from keyword return values. This change was already done during the RF 7.0 development, but it was reverted because it turned out we still used `VARIABLE` with variables created in the Variables section and with the new VAR syntax and i wasn't possible to change also these types in RF 7.0. We need to check all places where variables are created and see can we use a common type in all cases and what that type would be.\r\n\r\n2. We currently use the type `ARGUMENT` with too many different tokens. For example, we use it with IF and WHILE conditions and with variable values in the Variables section and with the VAR syntax. This means that if we wanted to support conditional variable assignment like `VAR    ${x}    IF    $cond    y    ELSE    z` both `$cont` and `y` would have the `ARGUMENT` type. This in turn would make it unnecessarily hard to find the condition and value tokens. It's not certain is this kind of conditional variable assignment a good idea in general, but we should nevertheless change the token types so that implementation is possible. We could, for example, introduce a new `CONDITION` type to be used with all conditions.\r\n\r\n3. `RETURN` should be changed to mean the RETURN statement, not [Return] setting.\r\n\r\n4. There are some deprecated and unused token types we can remove. This includes `WITH_NAME`, `FORCE_TAGS`, `FATAL_ERROR`, `FATAL_INVALID_HEADER` and `RETURN_SETTING`.\r\n\r\n5. We should in general go through the token types and see do they make sense. The idea is to do a proper cleanup once and then try to keep the types stable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858","id":1885309238,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85wX4k2","number":4858,"title":"Remove support for singular section headers","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972220183,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4PFw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20small","name":"effort: small","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":20,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T16:09:30Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-09-07T07:47:27Z","updated_at":"2023-09-07T07:47:27Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Singular section headers were deprecated in RF 6.0 (#4431) and started to emit actual deprecation warnings in RF 7.0 (#4432).

Depending on the keyboard layout, writing them can also require annoying finger acrobatics. It would thus be convenient if it would be possible to use `$var` instead of `${var}` and also `@list`, `&dict` and `%env` instead of `@{list}`, `&{dict}` and `%{env}`. For example, all these could be supported:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n$VARIABLE        value\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Log    $VARIABLE\r\n    $var =    Keyword\r\n    FOR    $item    IN    @stuff\r\n        Log    $item\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn all the above cases the `$var` syntax is used on its own and that would work fine. This syntax wouldn't work too well when embedded to a string, though. For example, if you have variables `$name` and `$named`, string `Hello, $name!` could be parsed like `Hello, ${name}!`, but `abc$named` could be either `abc${name}d` or `abc${named}`. We could require using the `${var}` syntax in cases where `$var` is ambiguous, that's how [shell scripts](https://learn-bash.org/variables.html) work, but I believe it's better to require it always when variables are embedded. That makes the syntax more consistent and this approach is also considerably easier to implement. We can, however, look at this again later if the `$var` syntax is universally considered better and using it always (when possible) is considered important.\r\n\r\nSupporting the `$var` syntax would be a backwards incompatible change, but if we support it only when variables are used on their own, it shouldn't be that bad. It would mean that all arguments starting with `$`, `@`, `&` and `%` would need to be escaped like `\\$not_var`. We already require this with `#` (which otherwise starts a comment) so there's precedence for such syntax. Nevertheless, this would break lot of tests/tasks and the change can be made only in a major version. It would also be a good idea to deprecate using arguments starting with these characters already earlier. If this enhancement is considered important, it could be added in RF 7.0 and deprecation added in RF 6.2 or possibly already in RF 6.1.\r\n\r\nAlthough the basic syntax would be simple, there are some design decision to be made:\r\n\r\n1. Should we limit variable base name to only alpha numeric characters and underscore? In other words, should something like `$! als lkjas` be considered a variable with base name `! als lkjat` or should the whole thing be considered a literal string? Being more strict with the variable name would mean there's less need for escaping, but then these variables would work inconsistently compared to \"normal\" variables. It would also mean that some built-in variables like `${/}` couldn't be used like `$/`. I got a feeling that it's better if we don't limit the name. \r\n2. Should this syntax support item access like `$list[0]` and `$dict[key][nested]`? I believe it should.\r\n3. Should this syntax support \"extended variable syntax\" like `$var.upper()` and `$SPACE * 10`? I don't have too strong opinion on this, but I guess it would be better to support it. Needing to use `${var.upper()}` in this case would be a bit strange and inconsistent.\r\n\r\nI'll add this issue tentatively to RF 7.0 scope, but we still need to make a bit more official decision about it. If we decide to include it, then another issue should be submitted about deprecating arguments starting with `$` and other such variable meta characters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/reactions","total_count":9,"+1":5,"-1":3,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537","id":1451842501,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85WiVvF","number":4537,"title":"Support creating variables that are not logged even on TRACE level","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":20,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T16:09:30Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":9,"created_at":"2022-11-16T15:48:54Z","updated_at":"2023-08-25T13:19:37Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Often in automation we need to use passwords or other values that should not be logged. To help with that, various libraries have keywords that avoid logging given values even though their keywords normally do that. For example, SeleniumLibrary has `Input Password` that doesn't log the password and also temporarily disables Robot's logging to avoid the password being logged by the underlying Selenium on DEBUG level. This works fine otherwise, but if tests are run with `--loglevel TRACE`, Robot anyway logs all argument values and the password will be visible. Browser's `Fill Secret` tries to avoid that problem by requiring the value to be passed using a special `$var` syntax so that Robot won't log the actual variable value. Unfortunately that doesn't work if the value is passed to `Fill Secret` via a user keyword and only that keyword uses the `$var` syntax like in the following example:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${PASSWORD}        secret\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Keyword    ${PASSWORD}    # This value is logged on TRACE level\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nKeyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${pwd}\r\n    Fill Secret    selector    $pwd\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to use values that should not be logged, I propose we add new variable syntax `*{var}` to create \"secret variables\". The syntax could be used when creating variables in the Variables section, when creating local variables based on keyword return values, and with `Set Global/Suite/Test/Local Variable` keywords. The syntax would be only used for creating variables, they would be used normally like `${var}`:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n*{PASSWORD}        secret\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Keyword    ${PASSWORD}\r\n    *{local} =    Another keyword\r\n    Keyword    ${local}\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nKeyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${pwd}\r\n    Fill Secret    selector    ${pwd}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTechnically the `*{var}` assignment would create a custom object with this kind of implementation:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Secret:\r\n    def __init__(self, value, name=None):\r\n        self.value = value\r\n        self.name = name\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        return f'<Secret {self.name}>' if self.name else '<Secret>'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese objects would be used when the variable is passed from tests to user keywords and from user keywords to other user keywords. The real value would, however, be passed to library keywords so they would get values normally and wouldn't need to be changed to benefit from this new syntax.\r\n\r\nAlthough this new syntax would work with existing keywords, we should make it possible for library keywords to require arguments to be \"secret\". That's basically what `Fill Secret` does but this new syntax would avoid the problem that the value can be logged on higher level. A convenient way to support this would be type hints:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom robot.api.secrets import Secret\r\n\r\ndef example(secret: Secret):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would work so that Robot would validate that the used value is a `Secret` and fail if it's not. I believe we should pass the real value, not the actual `Secret` object, to the underlying keyword also in this case. That can confuse type checkers but keywords can use [typing.cast](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.cast) if that's a problem. To support normal type conversion, we should also allow parameterizing the type hint like `Secret[int]`.\r\n\r\nKeywords could also return secret values simply by returning `Secret` instances:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom robot.api.secrets import Secret\r\n\r\ndef example():\r\n    return Secret('value')\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478","id":1385930204,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Sm53c","number":4478,"title":"Simpler

automatic argument conversion (#2890) makes it possible to have a keywords like\r\n```python\r\ndef accept_list(arg: list):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\ndef accept_dict(arg: dict):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nand call them so that argument are Python literals\r\n```\r\nAccept List    ['list', 'items', 'here']\r\nAccept Dict    {'key': 'value', 'another': 'item'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty convenient, but needing to use Python syntax is a bit ugly in general and especially annoying when using embedded arguments that are supposed to enhance readability:\r\n```\r\nSelect animals ['cat', 'dog'] from list\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose we enhance argument conversion so that we support also the following syntax:\r\n```\r\nAccept List    list, items, here\r\nAccept Dict    key=value, another=item\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe high level semantics would be as follows:\r\n\r\n- Separator between items is a comma _and_ a space. This allows using commas in values like `first, second,with,commas, third`. Having a comma followed by a space in the value wouldn't be possible.\r\n- We could allow using a semicolon and a space as an alternative separator. In that case we'd use the separator that's encountered first. This would allow usages like `first; second, with, commas followed by spaces; third`.\r\n- With dictionaries the separator between key and value is `=`. This is the syntax we use also when creating `&{dict}` variables.\r\n- Values are considered strings by default. This can be changed by using generics (#4433) and `TypedDict` (#4477).\r\n- Because this would be handled by type convertors, variables would have been resolved already earlier. That means that something like `${1}, ${2}` wouldn't create a list of integers. See the above point for alternatives.\r\n- Also escapes are handled before type conversion. That makes it impossible to use something like `first, second\\,with\\,commas` for escaping commas in values.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement would ease using collections a lot especially if #4433 and #4477 are implemented. If we agree above semantics are fine, implementation would also be pretty easy. I thus add this to RF 5.1 scope even though the release is already late.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472","id":1379984865,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85SQOXh","number":4472,"title":"Allow resource files and libraries to be imported privately in other resource files","user":{"login":"BCGST","id":105816460,"node_id":"U_kgDOBk6hjA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105816460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST","html_url":"https://github.com/BCGST","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972226383,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4nTw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20extra%20large","name":"effort: extra large","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":20,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T16:09:30Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":12,"created_at":"2022-09-20T20:55:41Z","updated_at":"2023-08-25T11:29:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"It could be beneficial if users could import resource files and libraries in a \"private\" way. Currently, resource files are imported in a sort of recursive way where you have access to all keywords that resource file imports as well, as described in the user guide [here](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#resource-files). This can be unhelpful when you are abstracting a library or resource such that other contributors should not make direct calls to the underlying libraries.\r\n\r\nThis was especially important to me on a recent project where I was refactoring a test suite to be able choose whether to run with Browser library or SeleniumLibrary to compare their pros and cons. You could pick which browser control to use but writing a test that made direct keyword calls to the opposite library would cause that control to crash out. Using an abstracted resource file allows you to pick which library to use on the fly, however with recursive importation, a contributor could still mistakenly call a non-abstracted keyword from one or the other library and cause the opposing library crash the test when they reach the unexpected keyword.\r\n\r\nIn more biased terms, private importation of libraries and resources feels like a much more familiar mode for project structure for me given that is how python seems to handle resource/library importation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4395","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4395/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4395/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4395/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4395","id":1300958594,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Niw2C","number":4395,"title":"Give

These also override the default tags.\r\n\r\nThis is rather complicated and my understanding is that all three settings are rarely used. I propose we simplify this so that in the future we'd only have two settings:\r\n\r\n- `Test Tags` in the Settings section to specify tags tests always get. Same as `Force Tags` nowadays.\r\n- `[Tags]` with each test to specify tags tests get in addition to the `Test Tags`.\r\n\r\nThe functional difference compared to the current behavior is that there wouldn't be a possibility to specify tags tests get by default but that they could override when needed. For example, something like this wouldn't be possible anymore:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nForce Tags      all have\r\nDefault Tags    most have\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nT1\r\n    No Operation\r\nT2\r\n    [Tags]    only one has\r\n    No Operation\r\nT3\r\n    No Operation\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of using `Default Tags` that some tests override, all tests that actually need these tags must list them explicitly. The change wouldn't be overly big and I actually like this better:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nTest Tags      all have\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nT1\r\n    [Tags]    most have\r\n    No Operation\r\nT2\r\n    [Tags]    only one has\r\n    No Operation\r\nT3\r\n    [Tags]    most have\r\n    No Operation\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change is obviously backwards incompatible and cannot be done without a deprecation period. I propose we do it like this:\r\n- In RF 5.1 add `Test Tags` that basically acts as an alias for `Force Tags`. Also document that `Test Tags` and `[Tags]` are the way forward.\r\n- In RF 6.0 deprecate `Force Tags` and `Default Tags`.\r\n- In RF 7.0 remove `Force Tags` and `Default Tags`.\r\n\r\nThis is currently only a proposal and comments are welcome!

For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing('example')\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords. It is possible to use `BuiltIn.run_keyword` to execute other keywords so that they are shown as child keywords and #4237 discusses better APIs for that usage.\r\n\r\nA problem with using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` is that keywords executed with it must be available as normal keywords either in the library running other keywords or in some other imported library. That's ok if keywords are usable on their own, but it is possible that child keywords cannot be used like that. This problem can be avoided by making it possible to run any callable as the [final proposal](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237#issuecomment-1058077142) in #4237 suggests. There could, however, be even better solutions for the underlying need.\r\n\r\nA solution I have been thinking is is using a context manager that would create a keyword in log (and in output.xml). We probably could use our existing `robot.running.Keyword` for that purpose. The usage could be something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    with Keyword('Do first thing', args=['example'], doc='Example'):\r\n        do_first_thing()\r\n    with Keyword('Do second thing'):\r\n        print('No need to call a method, implementation can be directly inside the context manager!')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the main benefits of this approach compared to `BuitlIn.run_keyword` would be:\r\n1. No need to expose child keywords as real keywords.\r\n2. No need to even make each child keyword a callable. Implementation could be directly inside the context manager.\r\n3. It would be possible to add documentation, tags, etc. to be shown in the log file.\r\n\r\nPoints 1. and 3. would be possible also with `execute_keyword` proposed in #4237. Executing other keywords has also other use cases than logging child keywords, so #4237 is likely needed anyway. It's not certain is 2. alone worth enough to implement this feature. Possibly using a context manager could result with cleaner code, though.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4252/reactions","total_count":4,"+1":4,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237","id":1140704583,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85D_cVH","number":4237,"title":"Better API for library keywords to execute other keywords","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972225384,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4jaA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20large","name":"effort: large","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":20,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T16:09:30Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":10,"created_at":"2022-02-16T23:50:50Z","updated_at":"2023-08-25T11:29:11Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"It is a relatively common need for library keywords to be able to run other keywords. One good example is SeleniumLibrary, that makes it possible to register a keyword that will be executed if any of its own keywords fails. Sometimes, especially when doing task automation, it is also beneficial to log actions done by the keyword in the log file separately. For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing()\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords, but there are sometimes needs to show `do_first_thing` and `do_second_thing` as child keywords.\r\n\r\nNowadays keywords can execute other keywords by using `BuiltIn.run_keyword`. It works but has several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Arguments are resolved twice. This  means replacing variables and handling syntax like `\\n`. For example, if we have a keyword like\r\n    ```python\r\n    def example(arg):\r\n        BuiltIn().run_keyword('Log To Console', arg)\r\n    ```\r\n    and call it like\r\n    ```\r\n    Example    c:\\\\temp\r\n    ```\r\n    the actually logged string has a tab character. The reason is that `\\\\t` is first resolved to string `\\t` which is then on the second round resolved to a tab.\r\n\r\n    Double resolving can be avoided be registering the keyword to be a \"run keyword variant\", but that API isn't really public and it's also pretty bad in general. We have #2190 about enhancing it and making it public, but it would probably be better to avoid this double resolving altogether.\r\n\r\n2. Related to above, the keyword using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` cannot safely call it without escaping strings. For example, something like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Log To Console', 'c:\\\\temp')` won't work correctly and the argument should be `c:\\\\\\\\temp` instead.\r\n\r\n3. `BuiltIn.run_keyword` only accepts positional arguments. For example, if we had a keyword implemented like\r\n    ```pyhton\r\n    def example(upper=False):\r\n        ...\r\n    ```\r\n    we couldn't call it like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Example', upper=True)` but instead needed to use `BuiltIn.run_keywod('Example', 'upper=True')`.\r\n\r\nThe above examples ought to make it clear that a better API is needed. I have some ideas how to API could look and will write separate comments about that a bit later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170","id":1080815625,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Aa_AJ","number":4170,"title":"Tests

I expect it to fail as if in case when the non-matching value was given to the keyword directly.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"reopened","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3423","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3423/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3423/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3423/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3423","id":541348081,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU1NDEzNDgwODE=","number":3423,"title":"Possibility to use output.json in addition to output.xml","user":{"login":"teaglebuilt","id":18645015,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE4NjQ1MDE1","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/18645015?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/teaglebuilt","html_url":"https://github.com/teaglebuilt","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teaglebuilt/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teaglebuilt/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teaglebuilt/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teaglebuilt/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teaglebuilt/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teaglebuilt/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teaglebuilt/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teaglebuilt/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/teaglebuilt/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":20,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T16:09:30Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":47,"created_at":"2019-12-21T17:04:23Z","updated_at":"2023-12-18T21:58:49Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Problem:\r\n\r\nPrefer to use a NOSQL database to store test reports.

That has worked very well, and it would be nice if something like that would work also with variables defined in test data. We probably could re-use the underlying argument conversion logic which ought to make it relatively easy to implement this. We also got a similar request related to variables passed from the command line #2946.\r\n\r\nAutomatically converting numbers like `42` and `3.14` to actual integers/floats would be handy, even when we already support them as variables like `${42}` and `${3.14}`. Being able to use datatime objects, bytes, and other types supported by the argument conversion that don't have direct variable alternatives would naturally be even more useful (but also less commonly needed). I would expect this to be most useful with lists and dictionaries and especially with nested list and dicts that cannot easily be constructed in Robot's data.\r\n\r\nMy proposed syntax for this functionality is supporting \"type postfix\" like `:int` in variable names like this:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${COUNT:int}         42\r\n${GOOD IDEA:bool}    Yes    # Converted to Boolean True\r\n${ANIMALS:list}      ['cat', 'dog', 'horse']    # Python syntax\r\n${NESTED:dict}       {'a': 1, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}    # Great with JSON\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax is derived from Python's function annotation syntax and also the same syntax that was decided to be used with command line variables in #2946. Variable names would naturally be created without the type prefix like `${COUNT}` and `${GOOD IDEA}`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being available in the variable section, the new syntax should also be available also when creating variable otherwise, including in keyword arguments:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nExample\r\n    [Arguments]    ${count:int}\r\n    ${nested:dict} =    Set Variable    {'a': ${count}, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}\r\n    Set Test Variable    ${DATE:datetime}     2019-08-23 12:03:42\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are some design decision still to be made like should `${X:dict}` create a `DotDict` instance that allows `${X.key}` syntax and how to handle possible backwards incompatibility issues. For most parts the design looks pretty good, though, and I think this would be a valuable addition to Robot Framework. If there's enough interest, we can consider adding this already to RF 3.2 scope.

(at least, when they can be resolved in the resource-file scope as when we have been explicitly imported the corresponding library)\r\n\r\nP.S.: I know that it is intended that keywords can be resolved at runtime to allow dynamically decide the implementation (I do not remember where I read about that behaviour though). However, this seems to hamper Robot framework keywords reusability, forcing us to work around by prefixing keywords, renaming them (globally unique...!), or implementing these keywords in a .py file (to be imported via Library). Please, you can also consult [this resource example](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#example-resource-file) in the official user guide for additional evidences on how misleading is the current non-local scope resolution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2581/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2190","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2190/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2190/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2190/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2190","id":114558284,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxMTQ1NTgyODQ=","number":2190,"title":"Clean-up semi-public API to register \"run keyword variants\" and to disable variable resolving in arguments","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":20,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T16:09:30Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":12,"created_at":"2015-11-02T09:32:51Z","updated_at":"2023-11-14T14:01:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Robot has a mechanism to disable resolving variables in arguments using `robot.libraries.BuiltIn.register_run_keyword` method.

long failure messages (over 40 lines by default, configurable with `--max-error-lines` (#2576)) are cut from the middle. This is done to avoid huge messages messing up logs and reports, but the problem is that some valuable information may be lost. Another issue is that even the resulting messages are somewhat long and take lot of space.\r\n\r\nThe above is an old problem, but the situation is getting worse in RF 7.0 due failure messages being shown not only with tests,but also with each keyword and control structure. Earlier keywords and control structures in the result model didn't have a message at all, but it was added as part of the result model cleanup (#4883). The motivation was this:\r\n- We are adding JSON representation to the result model (#4847) and want the model to be as stable and future-proof as possible.\r\n- We likely want to in the future allow running individual keywords outside Robot core. At that point we want the result model to have a message, not only status as earlier.\r\n- In some special cases (at least with `--flatten-keywords` and `--remove-keywords`) we want to add some extra notes to result objects. Earlier we used documentation for that, but it was odd because control structures such as FOR loops cannot otherwise have a documentation. Using the message for this purpose works much better.\r\n\r\nNow that also keywords and control structures also have a message, the same message can be shown on multiple levels in the log file. That's rather annoying in general, but gets especially irritating if the message is long. To mitigate this issue, and to fix the old issue with long messages, I propose we do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Show only the beginning of long failure messages in log and report by default. I believe we should show so much that typical messages are shown fully, but considerably less than 40 lines that is the current maximum.

In practice there's [libdoc.html](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/tree/master/src/robot/htmldata/libdoc) file that contains template code as well as JavaScript. It also uses external styles and some external JavaScript files used also by Rebot.\r\n\r\nThe explained setup has worked fine for us, but there's a problem that jQuery Templates have been unmaintained for years. We need to find a replacement for it and at the same time we should enhance our HTML/JavaScript setup in general. At least the following tasks should be done:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Find a replacement for jQuery Templates. We could use its successor [JsRender](https://www.jsviews.com/) or some totally new technology like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).\r\n- [ ] Separate JavaScript code from HTML templates as much as possible.\r\n- [ ] Add tests for JavaScript model code.

Otherwise, it is converted to `bytes` the same way as if the keyword would have used `arg: bytes`.\r\n\r\nI don't consider these semantics too useful. I don't see how often you'd like to have a keyword that gets either `bytes` or `bytearray`, when you could use `arg: bytes` or `arg: bytearray` to get one of them. More importantly, if you have such a need, using `arg: bytes | bytearray` works exactly the same way and makes then intention more clear.\r\n\r\nRemoving the support for `ByteString` conversion is obviously a backwards incompatible change, but I doubt there are many users for it, they can easily use `bytes | bytearray` instead, and they anyway need to do that relatively soon when `ByteString` will be gone. I wish we would have done this earlier in RF 7.0 development cycle, but believe doing it still now before the release candidate is fine.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4983/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4983/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4982","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4982/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4982/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4982/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4982","id":2046052749,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ8559EmN","number":4982,"title":"DateTime:

It returns a `Result` object, that contains a `TestSuite` object in its `suite` attribute. The suite can be inspected and also modified, and the `Result` object has a `save` method for saving results back to XML after possible modifications. This is ok for many usages, but having a more convenient API for working with `TestSuite` objects would be nice.\r\n\r\nThe result model gets `to/from_json` methods in RF 7.0 (#4847) and we could add `to/from_xml` to `TestSuite` as well. Similarly as the JSON counterparts, `to_xml` should return the XML by default, but also support writing it to a file. `from_xml` should work both with files and XML strings as well. We have all needed functionality for reading and writing XML available, so implementing these methods is easy. There are some design decision to be made, though:\r\n\r\n1. Should the `<suite>` structure returned by `to_xml` be wrapped with `<robot></robot>` the same way as in output.xml? I believe it's not a good idea at least by default. The suite anyway wouldn't have anything to write to `<errors>` and although `<statistics>` could be created, it would feel somewhat strange. Returning just the `<suite>` is also consistent with what `to_json` returns. Being able to create a full output.xml with something like `full=True` could be convenient, but it can be added later if needed.\r\n2. Should XML returned by `to_xml` contain the XML prolog (i.e. `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>`)? I believe it's not a good idea at least as the default behavior. It's optional in XML and could get in the way. Probably should be included if we supported something like `full=True`.\r\n3. Should `from_xml` support both \"full\" output.xml files and files containing only `<suite>`? I belive both should be supportred. Not supporting normal output.xml files would be *very* inconvenient and not supporting files generated by `to_xml` would be unacceptable. This is probably easiest to implement so that we in general support output.xml with and without `<robot>`.\r\n4. What to do if `from_xml` is used with an output.xml containing `<errors>`? Options include ignoring them, reporting them or raising an exception. Because `<errors>` doesn't really affect the final execution status, I believe we can ignore them as long as it's mentioned in the documentation. Adding something like ` ignore_errors=True` that can be set to `False` could be considered as well, but probably those who are interested in these errors can just use `ExecutionResult`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4979/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4979/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4976","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4976/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4976/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4976/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4976","id":2041565598,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ855r9Ge","number":4976,"title":"Support

To better explain it, here's a simple test case to reproduce the error:\r\n```\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nSuite Setup    Test Suite Setup\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nVariable Test\r\n    Log    ${test_variable}\r\n    Set Suite Variable    \\${test_variable}    test case level content\r\n    Log    ${test_variable}\r\n    Check Variable\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nTest Suite Setup\r\n    Set Suite Variable    \\${test_variable}    suite setup level content    children=${True}\r\n    Log    ${test_variable}\r\n    Check Variable\r\n\r\nCheck Variable\r\n    Log    ${test_variable}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the suite setup, the suite variable ${test_variable} is set using children=${True}. Logging the variable directly afterwards and additionally in the separate keyword \"Check Variable\" returns the correct value \"suite setup level content\".\r\nThen in the test case, the suite variable is overwritten with \"test case level content\". Logging the variable before that step returns \"suite setup level content\" and after overwriting the variable the logging returns \"test case level content\" as expected.\r\nHowever, when executing \"Check Variable\" again in the test case, the value is again \"suite setup level content\", so the old value instead of the new.\r\n\r\nYou may say now that the \"children\" parameter does not make sense to use on this level, but the same problem also occurs when I set the suite variable on a higher level in the __init__.robot file. Only because of simplicity I did it now in the suite setup of the same robot file. But nonetheless, using it on this level with the \"children\" parameter shouldn't lead to this behavior.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the issue happens even on multiple levels if there are more suite setups on different levels. \r\nThat means, if I set the suite variable in the __init__.robot file to the value \"a\", then execute \"Check Variable\" in the __init__.robot file, the value is \"a\" (as expected). Then in the \"Test Suite Setup\" keyword I set the value to \"b\", but \"Check Variable\" still returns \"a\". Then in the test case, I set the value to \"c\", but \"Check Variable\" returns this time \"b\", so always the value which was set \"one layer above\".","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4964/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4964/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4960","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4960/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4960/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4960/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4960","id":2011611926,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ8535sMW","number":4960,"title":"Support

While doing that, we noticed that four Collections keywords already supported case-insensitivity and had `case_insensitive` argument for that purpose. This kind of inconsistency within a library isn't great, so something needs to be done to it.\r\n\r\nAn easy solution would be using `case_insensitive` also with the new keywords. That would make Collections consistent, but because we use `ignore_case` in BuiltIn (#2439), different libraries would be inconsistent. I believe we should aim for consistency with all standard libraries and also believe that that `ignore_case` is a better argument name than `case_insensitive`. It is also consistent with other similar arguments like `ignore_order` and `ignore_keys` in Collections.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to do the following:\r\n- Add `ignore_case` argument to Collections keywords that accept `case_insensitive`. The old argument should be preserved for now, but it should be mentioned in the documentation that the new one is preferred. We shouldn't yet emit deprecation warnings, but we can start doing that in RF 8.0.\r\n- For consistency reasons, add `ignore_whitespace` to these same keywords as an alias for `whitespace_insensitive`. It should be treated the same way a `case_insensitive`.\r\n- For consistency reasons, add `ignore_case` as an alias also for the two String library keywords that accept `case_insensitive`.\r\n\r\nAlthough we won't be emitting deprecation warnings, it's good to mention this under the deprecated features section in the release notes.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4954/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4954/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4952","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4952/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4952/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4952/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4952","id":2005409981,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ853iCC9","number":4952,"title":"Collections:

That has a problem that using something like `x: 'int | float'` will cause an error with Python < 3.10. We just added support for such stringified types in arguments (#4711) and supporting them with `TypedDict` would be good as well. I guess we need to use `get_type_hints` first and then access `__annotations__` as a fall-back.

We do have situations where we deprecate positional args in favour of named only ones. In these cases we introduce a `*varags` argument that collects all old positional args and assigns them in the old order to the variables inside. Therefore there is no type hinting in the arguments. but we have a Catalog of the original types which can be used to convert.\r\n2. We do have keywords like `Promise To` and `Wait For Condition` which calls our keywords internally and has `*args` to take the arguments. These two keywords iterate over the called keywords interface and try to convert the arguments according to their type. Also in this case we want/need to support dynamic argument conversion.\r\n\r\nFor us it is not really important, if exactly this function `converter_for()` will stay compatible or if a new function will be implemented to get to get the proper converter for a Python type.\r\nHowever it would be more convenient for our users to stay compatible, so they do not necessarily need to update Browser,

From the documentation of the latter:\r\n\r\n> Casefolding is similar to lowercasing but more aggressive because it is intended to remove all case distinctions in a string. For example, the German lowercase letter 'ß' is equivalent to \"ss\". Since it is already lowercase, [lower()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.lower) would do nothing to 'ß'; [casefold()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.casefold) converts it to \"ss\".\r\n\r\nThere aren't too many cases where the difference between `lower` and `casefold` matters, but there's no performance difference between them either and the change is trivial. This change should be done at least to our `normalize()` utility that is used internally in various places both directly and indirectly. Should also change keywords in BuiltIn that support case-insensitivity the same way.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4935/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4935/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4934","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4934/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4934/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4934/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4934","id":1981604110,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ852HOEO","number":4934,"title":"Enhance performance of visiting parsing model","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":175630288,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzU2MzAyODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/alpha%201","name":"alpha 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""},{"id":911065884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MTEwNjU4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/acknowledge","name":"acknowledge","color":"bc82e0","default":false,"description":"To be acknowledged in release notes"},{"id":4972220183,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4PFw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20small","name":"effort: small","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/64","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/64","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/64/labels","id":7828494,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Ad3QO","number":64,"title":"v7.0","description":"A major release supporting `start/end_keyword` methods with the listener API v3 (#3296), native `VAR` syntax for creating variables (#3761) and mixing embedded and normal arguments with library keywords (#4710) as well as various other interesting new features.

Clicking the selector allows selecting levels, so this is just a visual UI problem. Running tests with the WARN level is rare, but we could have the level there also otherwise to allow hiding also INFO messages. Implementing this requires only adding `WARN` as one of the possible options in the selector.\r\n\r\nThe same issue occurs also with the ERROR level. I see even less needs to run tests with the ERROR level than there are needs to use WARN and having WARN is already enough to allow hiding INFO messages. Due to how the log level selector is implemented, this would also require considerably more work. I don't think it's worth the effort.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4927/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4927/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4926","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4926/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4926/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4926/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4926","id":1975019509,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ851uGf1","number":4926,"title":"WHILE

Open terminal and create a test suite file `stuck.robot` with content\r\n```\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nMy Teardown\r\n    WHILE  True  limit=3\r\n        Log To Console  Sleep 1 second\r\n        Sleep  1\r\n    END\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nMy Test\r\n    No Operation\r\n    [Teardown]    My Teardown\r\n```\r\n2. Run test: `robot stuck.robot`\r\n\r\n### Actual results\r\nRobot output looks normal until while loop limit is reached:\r\n```\r\n==============================================================================\r\nStuck\r\n==============================================================================\r\nMy Test                                                               .Sleep 1 second\r\nSleep 1 second\r\nSleep 1 second\r\n```\r\nThen robot appears stuck. Host resource monitor indicates high CPU usage. It is possible to force exit by hitting `CTRL+C` more than once.\r\n\r\n### Reproducibility\r\nReproduced 10 times out of 10 on my local PC (first one in the list below).

least `get_tokens`, `get_model`, and their resource and init file variants need to get type hints and adding them is easy. Adding types to the whole parsing module would be good too, but that may be too much work for RF 6.1. If it is, a separate issue about that should be submitted for RF 6.2.\r\n\r\nOne reason to add type hints is that they can enable using [mypyc](https://mypyc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for compiling the parsing module into a C extension. That could help making parsing faster as part of execution and, probably more importantly, when used by IDEs or other external tools. Full `mypy` or `mypyc` compatibility isn't in the scope of this issue, but the better the type hints are, the easier it is to continue to that direction in the future.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4740/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4740/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4736","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4736/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4736/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4736/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4736","id":1665308172,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85jQpYM","number":4736,"title":"Backslash

This can be fixed so that backslashes used for preventing newlines are removed from the documentation before rows are joined together.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty annoying bug, but luckily there are very seldom needs to prevent the automatic newline. For example, in the above case the documentation in log and report looks exactly the same when formatted as a HTML paragraph.

execution just some tests from a big directory structure, parsing only relevant files instead of the whole structure makes parsing faster. We don't currently have any explicit option for limiting parsing like that, but when the `--suite` option is used files not matching the specified suite are ignored. This functionality won't work too well in the future, though, if we make it possible to change the suite name using the `Name` setting (#4583). It's also likely that not too many users know about this functionality and the underlying logic to convert file and directory names to suite names for matching purposes is also rather complicated.\r\n\r\nA good way to solve all the above problems is adding a separate command line option or options for controlling what files to parse. Once we have such functionality, we can remove the current performance optimization from `--suite`, a separate option makes the feature easier to discover, and also the code gets simpler. There are some design decisions to be made, though:\r\n\r\n- What should the option be named? I was thinking `--includefiles`, but it has the same prefix as `--include` which would mean that shortened usages like `--incl` that used to be unique wouldn't work anymore. Perhaps `--parsefiles` or just `--files` would be better.\r\n- Should the value be a literal value or should we accept glob patterns? I believe supporting patterns is a good idea.\r\n- Should the value be just a file name or a relative or absolute path to it? I see benefits with both so possibly we could support both usages.\r\n- Should the value include file extension? I believe it should be allowed but preferably not required. If that gets too complicated, always requiring it is probably better.\r\n- Should there be separate option for excluding files? It would make some use cases easier, but I'm not sure is that worth the added complexity.\r\n- Should this option affect only files or also directories? If the option would match a directory, we could automatically include all files under it, recursively. On the other hand, just matching files would be easier to implement and explain.\r\n- Should we have separate options for matching files and directories? That's probably too much, especially if we'd have separate options for including and excluding. If directories are considered important, probably better to implement this so that the same option work with both files and directories.\r\n\r\nThis feature should be implemented before RF 7 where we'd like to change `--suite` so that it doesn't affect parsing. That would give users who need the performance optimization time to update their

added support for the optional start index in RF 4.0 (#3781). It was implemented so that only the runner object detected that the last iterated value has `start=` prefix and the parser doesn't know anything about it. When similar configuration was added to `WHILE` (`limit`) and `EXCEPT` (`type`), they were already recognized by the parser making the behavior with `start` inconsistent. This should be changed and `start` with `FOR IN ENUMERATE` loops handled by the parser as well.\r\n\r\nHandling `start` in the parser means that the `For` model object in the `TestSuite` structure needs `start` attribute as well. The same `For` is used with all `FOR` loop types and it getting an attribute that only affects one of them is a bit questionable, but I don't consider it too big a problem. We could consider adding separate `ForInEnumerate`, `ForInRange` and `ForInZip` model object, but I consider that too much work compared to benefits at least right now. We also need to add `start` as an attribute to `output.xml`.

when you have an invalid setting like `[Setpu]` in a test (or keyword, or task), error is reported on the console, but the test is nevertheless executed and in the log file the invalid setting isn't visible under the test at all. This isn't great. It would be better if the invalid setting would be visible under the test in the log file and it should also fail the test.\r\n\r\nA similar situation occurs with invalid syntax like `END` or `ELSE` without an opening `IF`. At the moment such invalid syntax is considered to be a keyword. We have `Reserved` library that contains matching keywords, so when these \"keywords\" are run they fail. Invalid syntax reported as failing keywords is odd and the resulting error messages aren't great either. A part of #4210 is detecting this kind of invalid syntax already at the parsing time, but we need to also show them in the log file somehow.\r\n\r\nA solution to both of these error reporting issues is adding new `Error` object to our `TestSuite` structure. When the parser detects invalid syntax, it can create such objects, and when they are run they can simply fail. These errors should create new `<error>` elements to output.xml and they obviously need to be show in log.html as well.\r\n\r\nA problem with this enhancement is that it's not fully backwards compatible:\r\n- Invalid settings like `[Setpu]` don't currently affect test status, but in the future they will fail the test. An obvious solution for this kind of problem is not having such invalid settings in tests in the first place.\r\n- External tools parsing output.xml need to take `<error>` elements into account. In general such tools should ignore elements they don't recognize, but there certainly can be tools that don't behave like that.\r\n- Tools working with the `TestSuite` model need to take new `Error` objects into account.\r\n\r\nInvalid syntax failing a test isn't a big concern for me, but this change possibly breaking external tools is a lot bigger problem. I don't see any other ways this could be handed, though. Doing the change in a non-major version is a bit questionable, but I don't think postponing this change to RF 7 (or changing RF 6.1 to RF 7) is a good idea either. We just need to inform external tool developers about this change in release notes and possibly also otherwise.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682","id":1620330369,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85glEeB","number":4682,"title":"Make

`FOR IN ZIP` loop behaves like Python's  [zip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) so that if lists lengths aren't the same, items from the longest one are ignored. For example, the following loop would be executed only twice:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n@{ANIMALS}    dog      cat    horse    cow    elephant\r\n@{ELÄIMET}    koira    kissa\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    FOR    ${en}    ${fi}    IN ZIP    ${ANIMALS}    ${ELÄIMET}\r\n        Log    ${en} is ${fi} in Finnish\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior can cause problems when iterating over items received from the automated system. For example, the following test would pass regardless how many things `Get something` returns as long as the returned items match the expected values. The example even succeeds if `Get something` nothing.\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Validate something    expected 1    expected 2    expected 3\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ****\r\nValidate something\r\n    [Arguments]    @{expected}\r\n    @{actual} =    Get something\r\n    FOR    ${act}    ${exp}    IN ZIP    ${actual}    ${expected}\r\n        Validate one thing    ${act}    ${exp}\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo avoid the above example failing if `Get something` returns more or less values than expected, a separate check needs to be added. Because there's no ready-made keyword for checking are list lengths equal (`Lists should be equal` keyword doesn't work here), the validation needs to use something bit more complicated like this:\r\n```\r\n    Should be equal    ${{len($actual)}}    ${{len($expected)}}\r\n```\r\nFor a real life example see [this example](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/f7ee913622e60c0cf630e1580c2bb58c57100187/atest/robot/running/if/invalid_if.robot#L119) from out acceptance tests. Tests also contain various `FOR IN ZIP` usages where this particular issue could cause problems.\r\n\r\nThis same underlying issues has caused problems with Python's `zip` as well. Starting from Python 3.10 (see [PEP 619](https://peps.python.org/pep-0618/) `zip` has new `strict` parameter that can be used like `zip(actual, expected, strict=True)`. It causes a `ValueError` to be raised if iterated lists have different lengths. Related to this, Python also has separate [itertools.zip_longest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest) that goes through all items in all lists so that if certain list has less value than others, value specified with the `fillvalue` argument is used instead.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that we add new `mode` configuration option to `FOR IN ZIP` loops. The motivation is that we could have three values `shortest`, `strict` and `longest` emulating Python's behavior with `zip(...)`, `zip(..., strict=True=`), and `zip_longest(...)`, respectively. This was also [considered with Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0618/#add-several-modes-to-switch-between), but they decided to go with a Boolean option `strict` partly because they already have a separate `zip_longest`.\r\n\r\nAnother reason `mode` wasn't used with Python is that to properly support the `longest` case, it would require adding `fillvalue` that doesn't make sense with other modes. That's a valid concern in our case as well, but I don't consider it too big a problem. We don't at the moment support the `longest` case at all, so this would instead be a nice enhancement and a lot better syntax than separate `FOR IN ZIP LONGEST` would be.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680","id":1620223756,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85gkqcM","number":4680,"title":"User

common error when evaluating expressions with IF or otherwise is using something like\r\n```\r\nIF    ${x} == 'expected'\r\n    Keyword\r\nEND\r\n```\r\nwhen the variable `${x}` contains a string. Normal variables are resolved _before_ evaluating the expression, so if `${x}` contains a string `value`, the evaluated expression will be `value == 'expected'`. Evaluating it fails because `value` isn't quoted, it's thus considered a variable in Python, and no such variable exists. The resulting error is this:\r\n\r\n> Evaluating IF condition failed: Evaluating expression 'value == 'expected'' failed: NameError: name 'value' is not defined nor importable as module\r\n\r\nOne solution to this problem is quoting the variable like `'${x}' == 'expected'`, but that doesn't work if the variable value contains quotes or newlines. A better solution is using the special `$var` syntax like `$x == 'value'` that makes the variable available in the Python evaluation namespace (#2040). All this is explained in the [User Guide](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#evaluating-expressions), but there are many users who don't know about this and struggle with the syntax.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a such a common error, we should make the error more informative if the expression contains \"normal\" variables. We could, for example, show also the original expression and recommend quoting or using the \"special\" variable syntax. Possibly it could look like this:\r\n\r\n> Evaluating IF condition failed: Evaluating expression 'value == 'expected'' failed: NameError: name 'value' is not defined nor importable as module\r\n> The original expression was '${x} == 'expected''. Try using the '$var' syntax like '$x == 'expected'' to avoid resolving variables before the expression is evaluated. See the Evaluating expression appendix in the User Guide for more details.\r\n\r\nThere are few problems implementing this:\r\n1. Variables are solved before the [evaluate_expression](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/src/robot/variables/evaluation.py#L31) is called so this function doesn't know the original expression nor did it contain variables. This information needs to be passed to it, but in same cases (at least with inline Python evaluation) it isn't that easy.\r\n2. It's not easy to detect when exactly this extra information should be included into the error. Including it always when evaluating the expression fails can add confusion when the error isn't related to variables. It would probably better to include it only if evaluation fails for a NameError, but also in that case you could have an expression like `'${x}' == value` where the variable likely isn't a problem. We could try some heuristics to see what causes the error, but that's probably too much work compared to including the extra info in some cases where it's not needed.\r\n3. Coming up with a good but somewhat short error message isn't easy. I'm not totally happy with the above, but I guess it would be better than nothing.\r\n\r\nBecause this extra info is added only if evaluation fails, this should be a totally backwards compatible change. It would be nice to include it already into RF 6.1, but that release is already about to be late and this isn't that easy to implement, so RF 6.2 is probably a better target. If someone is interested to look at this, including it already into RF 6.1 ought to be possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4676/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670","id":1609324383,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85f7Fdf","number":4670,"title":"Parsing

This builder only works with suite files and not with resource files. The `LibraryDocumentation` factory method that uses `DocumentationBuilder` handles this problem internally similarly as it handles `DocumentationBuilder` not supporting resource files in PYTHONPATH so this doesn't affect Libdoc itself. It does, however, affect direct usage of `DocumentationBuilder`.\r\n\r\nChanges like this are always annoying, but in this case this isn't too severe because `DocumentationBuilder` isn't really part of the public API and `LibraryDocumentation` should be used instead of it. Alternatively, it's possible to use `ResourceDocBuilder` explicitly when working with resource files. The initial plan was to just document this behavior (#4517), but it is actually easy to fix this by making `DocumentationBuilder` a class instead of a factory method.\r\n\r\nA related problem is that Libdoc's public API isn't properly defined. A separate issue needs to be submitted about that. We can then explicitly recommend `LibraryDocumentation`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516","id":1424167138,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85U4xDi","number":4516,"title":"`Set

The process of loading custom language files should be separated from loading the real language.\r\n    - Before loading the real languages, the custom language files should be loaded, only then you can load the language\r\n    - I think this should also be done with the command line parameters, there should be 2 arguments, one for loading the custom language files and the current one for the real language\r\n\r\n4. it should be possible to create a `Languages` instance that does not insert English and the deprecated single forms of the headers automatically\r\n   - I currently have to filter it out again if I want to show only the specified languages e.g. in the completion.\r\n\r\nLet's discuss ;-)","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4494/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4494/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4493","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4493/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4493/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4493/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4493","id":1395446781,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85TLNP9","number":4493,"title":"Libdoc: Support generating keyword documentation for suite files","user":{"login":"d-biehl","id":7069968,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwNjk5Njg=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7069968?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-biehl","html_url":"https://github.com/d-biehl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-biehl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-biehl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-biehl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-biehl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-biehl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-biehl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-biehl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-biehl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/d-biehl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":230194665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzAxOTQ2NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/rc%202","name":"rc 2","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v6.0","description":"New main release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

Analysis showed that the time was taken by calls to the Built in keyword `Keyword should exist`. In that particular situation it could take more than a second for a single call to `Keyword should exist` to return, with an average of 400ms. Anything above 500ms was causing failures.\r\n\r\nFurther analysis revealed the time to be spend on finding keyword recommendations. Finding these recommendations is a very useful feature when you misspell a keyword during test case development. However, when explicitly checking for a keyword's existence at runtime, the boolean answer suffices. In fact, in the current implementation the recommendations are disposed and not included in the reported failure.\r\n\r\nA proposed solution is available in

New issue (#4454) was submitted about enhancing conflict resolution the problematic regexps explained in the aforementioned comment wouldn't be needed.\r\n\r\nImproved conflict resolution works well and will be part of RF 5.1, but it is still not safe to make custom regexp validation more strict.

A solution to this problem, recommended in the [User Guide](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#using-custom-regular-expressions), has been using custom patterns that limit what keywords match. For example, changing the first keyword to `Execute \"${command:[^\"]+}\"` would mitigate the issue.\r\n\r\nIssue #4069 proposes making custom patterns more strict so that they would be validated also when the argument is given as a variable. As the comment referenced above explains, this unfortunately causes problems if patterns have been used for resolving conflicts as explained above.\r\n\r\nA solution to the problem caused by conflicts, that would also allow us making custom pattern validation more strict, would be Robot somehow being able to detect what is the \"best\" match. For a human it is pretty clear that if you use `Execute \"x\" on device \"y\"`, `Execute \"${command}\" on device \"${device}\"` matches better than `Execute \"${command}\"`, but the problem is how Robot can detect that. It's also a question that can it always detect it right or could there be false positives. I have one pretty simple approach in mind that I explain in a separate comment.

For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef my_keyword(time: timedelta) -> float:\r\n    return time.total_seconds()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill fail cleanly during runtime if user tries to pass something incompatible like a list:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: Argument 'time' got value '[1]' (list) that cannot be converted to timedelta.\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'total_seconds'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this validation only exists for [supported types](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/5.0/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#supported-conversions) and types that has user defined [custom converters](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/5.0/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#custom-argument-converters).\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nAs discussed in issue #3690 backwards compatibility limits us for enabling type guarding on default. One option would be adding a library level toggle but having too many options in `@library` is not desirable either.\r\n\r\nOther option would be adding a special [custom converter](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/5.0/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#custom-argument-converters) that only validates that argument [is instance](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance) of the type. For example like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nROBOT_LIBRARY_CONVERTERS = {\r\n    CustomType1: None,\r\n    CustomType2: None\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `None` would be a shortcut for this pattern:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _typechecked(_):\r\n    raise ValueError()\r\n\r\nROBOT_LIBRARY_CONVERTERS = {\r\n    CustomType1: _typechecked,\r\n    CustomType2: _typechecked\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more implementation details see this [comment](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3690#issuecomment-1220547740).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4440/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438","id":1341473874,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85P9URS","number":4438,"title":"`Get Time` returns current time if it is given input time that matches epoch","user":{"login":"spu06th","id":19752636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzUyNjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19752636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th","html_url":"https://github.com/spu06th","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":230194541,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzAxOTQ1NDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/beta%202","name":"beta 2","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v6.0","description":"New main release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

The main reason the singular form has ever been supported than in the early days Robot's data was in HTML tables and tables typically had headers like in this example:\r\n\r\n| Test Case | Keyword | Argument | Argument |\r\n| -- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\r\n| Example | Log | Message |   |\r\n\r\nNowadays there are no concrete benefits in supporting both header formats. There are, however, some drawbacks:\r\n- Supporting multiple formats like this makes the overall syntax a bit more complicated to learn and for external tools to support.\r\n- It makes translation effort (#4390) a bit bigger.\r\n- As pointed out in [this comment](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4390#issuecomment-1213425595) to #4390, some languages support also a [dual form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_(grammatical_number)) that we should support if we support both singular and plural forms.\r\n\r\nAdding support for the dual form wouldn't be a big task, but it would make the overall syntax even more complicated. A much simpler solution is supporting only the plural form. We can consider the section header like `Test Cases` to indicate that \"below this header we have tests\" and it works fine regardless how many tests there actually are. We have thus made a decision to:\r\n\r\n- support only the plural form with translations (covered by #4390), and\r\n- remove the support for singular form with English.\r\n\r\nWe obviously cannot just remove the support of singular headers in RF 5.1 because the change would be backwards incompatible. These are the steps we are planning to take instead:\r\n\r\n1. Document that singular headers are deprecated in RF 5.1 release notes and in the User Guide. No visible deprecation warning yet. This is covered by this issue.\r\n2. Start emitting deprecation warnings. This can earliest be done in RF 6.0, but we don't have too big hurry and waiting for 7.0 might be better. This is covered by #4432.\r\n3. Actually remove the support for singular headers. This can earliest be the next major release after the one where they are visibly deprecated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429","id":1336868939,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85PrwBL","number":4429,"title":"Allow passing flags to regexp related keywords using explicit `flags` argument","user":{"login":"oboehmer","id":22439451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM5NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22439451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer","html_url":"https://github.com/oboehmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":219378453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTkzNzg0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/beta%201","name":"beta 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""},{"id":911065884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MTEwNjU4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/acknowledge","name":"acknowledge","color":"bc82e0","default":false,"description":"To be acknowledged in release notes"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v6.0","description":"New main release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.
