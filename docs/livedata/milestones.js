To help with that, various libraries have keywords that avoid logging given values even though their keywords normally do that. For example, SeleniumLibrary has `Input Password` that doesn't log the password and also temporarily disables Robot's logging to avoid the password being logged by the underlying Selenium on DEBUG level. This works fine otherwise, but if tests are run with `--loglevel TRACE`, Robot anyway logs all argument values and the password will be visible. Browser's `Fill Secret` tries to avoid that problem by requiring the value to be passed using a special `$var` syntax so that Robot won't log the actual variable value. Unfortunately that doesn't work if the value is passed to `Fill Secret` via a user keyword and only that keyword uses the `$var` syntax like in the following example:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${PASSWORD}        secret\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Keyword    ${PASSWORD}    # This value is logged on TRACE level\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nKeyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${pwd}\r\n    Fill Secret    selector    $pwd\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to use values that should not be logged, I propose we add new variable syntax `*{var}` to create \"secret variables\". The syntax could be used when creating variables in the Variables section, when creating local variables based on keyword return values, and with `Set Global/Suite/Test/Local Variable` keywords. The syntax would be only used for creating variables, they would be used normally like `${var}`:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n*{PASSWORD}        secret\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Keyword    ${PASSWORD}\r\n    *{local} =    Another keyword\r\n    Keyword    ${local}\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nKeyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${pwd}\r\n    Fill Secret    selector    ${pwd}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTechnically the `*{var}` assignment would create a custom object with this kind of implementation:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Secret:\r\n    def __init__(self, value, name=None):\r\n        self.value = value\r\n        self.name = name\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        return f'<Secret {self.name}>' if self.name else '<Secret>'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese objects would be used when the variable is passed from tests to user keywords and from user keywords to other user keywords. The real value would, however, be passed to library keywords so they would get values normally and wouldn't need to be changed to benefit from this new syntax.\r\n\r\nAlthough this new syntax would work with existing keywords, we should make it possible for library keywords to require arguments to be \"secret\". That's basically what `Fill Secret` does but this new syntax would avoid the problem that the value can be logged on higher level. A convenient way to support this would be type hints:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom robot.api.secrets import Secret\r\n\r\ndef example(secret: Secret):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would work so that Robot would validate that the used value is a `Secret` and fail if it's not. I believe we should pass the real value, not the actual `Secret` object, to the underlying keyword also in this case. That can confuse type checkers but keywords can use [typing.cast](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.cast) if that's a problem. To support normal type conversion, we should also allow parameterizing the type hint like `Secret[int]`.\r\n\r\nKeywords could also return secret values simply by returning `Secret` instances:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom robot.api.secrets import Secret\r\n\r\ndef example():\r\n    return Secret('value')\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478","id":1385930204,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Sm53c","number":4478,"title":"Simpler

them so that argument are Python literals\r\n```\r\nAccept List    ['list', 'items', 'here']\r\nAccept Dict    {'key': 'value', 'another': 'item'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty convenient, but needing to use Python syntax is a bit ugly in general and especially annoying when using embedded arguments that are supposed to enhance readability:\r\n```\r\nSelect animals ['cat', 'dog'] from list\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose we enhance argument conversion so that we support also the following syntax:\r\n```\r\nAccept List    list, items, here\r\nAccept Dict    key=value, another=item\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe high level semantics would be as follows:\r\n\r\n- Separator between items is a comma _and_ a space. This allows using commas in values like `first, second,with,commas, third`. Having a comma followed by a space in the value wouldn't be possible.\r\n- We could allow using a semicolon and a space as an alternative separator. In that case we'd use the separator that's encountered first. This would allow usages like `first; second, with, commas followed by spaces; third`.\r\n- With dictionaries the separator between key and value is `=`. This is the syntax we use also when creating `&{dict}` variables.\r\n- Values are considered strings by default. This can be changed by using generics (#4433) and `TypedDict` (#4477).\r\n- Because this would be handled by type convertors, variables would have been resolved already earlier. That means that something like `${1}, ${2}` wouldn't create a list of integers. See the above point for alternatives.\r\n- Also escapes are handled before type conversion. That makes it impossible to use something like `first, second\\,with\\,commas` for escaping commas in values.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement would ease using collections a lot especially if #4433 and #4477 are implemented. If we agree above semantics are fine, implementation would also be pretty easy. I thus add this to RF 5.1 scope even though the release is already late.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472","id":1379984865,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85SQOXh","number":4472,"title":"Allow resource files and libraries to be imported privately in other resource files","user":{"login":"BCGST","id":105816460,"node_id":"U_kgDOBk6hjA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105816460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST","html_url":"https://github.com/BCGST","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972226383,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4nTw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20extra%20large","name":"effort: extra large","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":14,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2023-09-23T20:50:16Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":12,"created_at":"2022-09-20T20:55:41Z","updated_at":"2023-08-25T11:29:42Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"It could be beneficial if users could import resource files and libraries in a \"private\" way.

This can be unhelpful when you are abstracting a library or resource such that other contributors should not make direct calls to the underlying libraries.\r\n\r\nThis was especially important to me on a recent project where I was refactoring a test suite to be able choose whether to run with Browser library or SeleniumLibrary to compare their pros and cons. You could pick which browser control to use but writing a test that made direct keyword calls to the opposite library would cause that control to crash out.

the other library and cause the opposing library crash the test when they reach the unexpected keyword.\r\n\r\nIn more biased terms, private importation of libraries and resources feels like a much

currently have three settings for controlling tags tests get:\r\n\r\n- `Force Tags` in the Settings section for specifying tags tests will unconditionally get.\r\n- `Default Tags` in the Settings sections for specifying tags tests get, in addition to the forced tags, unless tests themselves have tags.\r\n- `[Tags]` with each tests to specify tags they get in addition to the forced tags. These also override the default tags.\r\n\r\nThis is rather complicated and my understanding is that all three settings are rarely used. I propose we simplify this so that in the future we'd only have two settings:\r\n\r\n- `Test Tags` in the Settings section to specify tags tests always get. Same as `Force Tags` nowadays.\r\n- `[Tags]` with each test to specify tags tests get in addition to the `Test Tags`.\r\n\r\nThe functional difference compared to the current behavior is that there wouldn't be a possibility to specify tags tests get by default but that they could override when needed. For example, something like this wouldn't be possible anymore:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nForce Tags      all have\r\nDefault Tags    most have\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nT1\r\n    No Operation\r\nT2\r\n    [Tags]    only one has\r\n    No Operation\r\nT3\r\n    No Operation\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of using `Default Tags` that some tests override, all tests that actually need these tags must list them explicitly. The change wouldn't be overly big and I actually like this better:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nTest Tags      all have\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nT1\r\n    [Tags]    most have\r\n    No Operation\r\nT2\r\n    [Tags]    only one has\r\n    No Operation\r\nT3\r\n    [Tags]    most have\r\n    No Operation\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change is obviously backwards incompatible and cannot be done without a deprecation period. I propose we do it like this:\r\n- In RF 5.1 add `Test Tags` that basically acts as an alias for `Force Tags`. Also document that `Test Tags` and `[Tags]` are the way forward.\r\n- In RF 6.0 deprecate `Force Tags` and `Default Tags`.\r\n- In RF 7.0 remove `Force Tags` and `Default Tags`.\r\n\r\nThis is currently only a proposal and comments are welcome!

For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing('example')\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords. It is possible to use `BuiltIn.run_keyword` to execute other keywords so that they are shown as child keywords and #4237 discusses better APIs for that usage.\r\n\r\nA problem with using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` is that keywords executed with it must be available as normal keywords either in the library running other keywords or in some other imported library. That's ok if keywords are usable on their own, but it is possible that child keywords cannot be used like that. This problem can be avoided by making it possible to run any callable as the [final proposal](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237#issuecomment-1058077142) in #4237 suggests. There could, however, be even better solutions for the underlying need.\r\n\r\nA solution I have been thinking is is using a context manager that would create a keyword in log (and in output.xml). We probably could use our existing `robot.running.Keyword` for that purpose. The usage could be something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    with Keyword('Do first thing', args=['example'], doc='Example'):\r\n        do_first_thing()\r\n    with Keyword('Do second thing'):\r\n        print('No need to call a method, implementation can be directly inside the context manager!')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the main benefits of this approach compared to `BuitlIn.run_keyword` would be:\r\n1. No need to expose child keywords as real keywords.\r\n2. No need to even make each child keyword a callable. Implementation could be directly inside the context manager.\r\n3.

One good example is SeleniumLibrary, that makes it possible to register a keyword that will be executed if any of its own keywords fails. Sometimes, especially when doing task automation, it is also beneficial to log actions done by the keyword in the log file separately. For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing()\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords, but there are sometimes needs to show `do_first_thing` and `do_second_thing` as child keywords.\r\n\r\nNowadays keywords can execute other keywords by using `BuiltIn.run_keyword`. It works but has several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Arguments are resolved twice. This  means replacing variables and handling syntax like `\\n`. For example, if we have a keyword like\r\n    ```python\r\n    def example(arg):\r\n        BuiltIn().run_keyword('Log To Console', arg)\r\n    ```\r\n    and call it like\r\n    ```\r\n    Example    c:\\\\temp\r\n    ```\r\n    the actually logged string has a tab character. The reason is that `\\\\t` is first resolved to string `\\t` which is then on the second round resolved to a tab.\r\n\r\n    Double resolving can be avoided be registering the keyword to be a \"run keyword variant\", but that API isn't really public and it's also pretty bad in general. We have #2190 about enhancing it and making it public, but it would probably be better to avoid this double resolving altogether.\r\n\r\n2. Related to above, the keyword using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` cannot safely call it without escaping strings. For example, something like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Log To Console', 'c:\\\\temp')` won't work correctly and the argument should be `c:\\\\\\\\temp` instead.\r\n\r\n3. `BuiltIn.run_keyword` only accepts positional arguments. For example, if we had a keyword implemented like\r\n    ```pyhton\r\n    def example(upper=False):\r\n        ...\r\n    ```\r\n    we couldn't call it like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Example', upper=True)` but instead needed to use `BuiltIn.run_keywod('Example', 'upper=True')`.\r\n\r\nThe above examples ought to make it clear that a better API is needed. I have some ideas how to API could look and will write separate comments about that a bit later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4069","id":980011349,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU5ODAwMTEzNDk=","number":4069,"title":"Variables acting as embedded arguments are not checked against regular expression","user":{"login":"MoreFamed","id":82573620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTczNjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82573620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed","html_url":"https://github.com/MoreFamed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":14,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2023-09-23T20:50:16Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":15,"created_at":"2021-08-26T09:06:07Z","updated_at":"2023-08-28T11:54:16Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Hi, I came across strange behaviour of RF regarding embedded arguments.

That has worked very well, and it would be nice if something like that would work also with variables defined in test data. We probably could re-use the underlying argument conversion logic which ought to make it relatively easy to implement this. We also got a similar request related to variables passed from the command line #2946.\r\n\r\nAutomatically converting numbers like `42` and `3.14` to actual integers/floats would be handy, even when we already support them as variables like `${42}` and `${3.14}`. Being able to use datatime objects, bytes, and other types supported by the argument conversion that don't have direct variable alternatives would naturally be even more useful (but also less commonly needed). I would expect this to be most useful with lists and dictionaries and especially with nested list and dicts that cannot easily be constructed in Robot's data.\r\n\r\nMy proposed syntax for this functionality is supporting \"type postfix\" like `:int` in variable names like this:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${COUNT:int}         42\r\n${GOOD IDEA:bool}    Yes    # Converted to Boolean True\r\n${ANIMALS:list}      ['cat', 'dog', 'horse']    # Python syntax\r\n${NESTED:dict}       {'a': 1, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}    # Great with JSON\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax is derived from Python's function annotation syntax and also the same syntax that was decided to be used with command line variables in #2946. Variable names would naturally be created without the type prefix like `${COUNT}` and `${GOOD IDEA}`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being available in the variable section, the new syntax should also be available also when creating variable otherwise, including in keyword arguments:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nExample\r\n    [Arguments]    ${count:int}\r\n    ${nested:dict} =    Set Variable    {'a': ${count}, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}\r\n    Set Test Variable    ${DATE:datetime}     2019-08-23 12:03:42\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are some design decision still to be made like should `${X:dict}` create a `DotDict` instance that allows `${X.key}` syntax and how to handle possible backwards incompatibility issues. For most parts the design looks pretty good, though, and I think this would be a valuable addition to Robot Framework. If there's enough interest, we can consider adding this already to RF 3.2 scope.

It would allow using keywords in places where currently you'd normally just have plain strings (or variables). Example usages are listed below and possible syntax alternatives discussed in separate comments.\r\n\r\n1. Arguments to other keywords. At the moment you need to this in two steps:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   ${result} =    Keyword    argument\r\n   Another Keyword    ${result}\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   In Python and other \"real\" programming languages you use something like `another_keyword(keyword('argument'))`, but in Robot's syntax\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   Another Keyword    Keyword    argument\r\n   ```\r\n   is parsed as `Another Keyword` getting two arguments. This cannot be changed so new syntax is needed.\r\n\r\n2. Condition to the forthcoming `IF/ELSE` syntax (#3074). Currently (well, in the future once IF/ELSE is supported), you need to use:\r\n   ```\r\n   ${status} =    Keyword\r\n   IF    ${status}\r\n       Another Keyword\r\n   END\r\n   ```\r\n   and\r\n   ```\r\n   IF    Keyword\r\n       Another Keyword\r\n   END\r\n   ```\r\n   would be parsed as `Keyword` being the expression to evaluate.\r\n\r\n3. Similarly existing FOR loops would benefit from this.\r\n\r\n4. Inline keyword call syntax would also allow adding support to create variables in the `Variables` section based on keyword return values. Currently that's not possible at all, and creating suite level variables dynamically requires using Suite Setup. Being able to do something like this is a pretty common request:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   *** Variables ***\r\n   ${EXAMPLE} =         Keyword    argument\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThe hardest thing related to this issue is coming up with a good syntax.

HTML outputs, similarly as log.html and report.html, use [jQuery Templates](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jquery-tmpl) for generating HTML content based on the date embedded to the outputs when they are created by Libdoc. In practice there's [libdoc.html](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/tree/master/src/robot/htmldata/libdoc) file that contains template code as well as JavaScript. It also uses external styles and some external JavaScript files used also by Rebot.\r\n\r\nThe explained setup has worked fine for us, but there's a problem that jQuery Templates have been unmaintained for years. We need to find a replacement for it and at the same time we should enhance our HTML/JavaScript setup in general. At least the following tasks should be done:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Find a replacement for jQuery Templates. We could use its successor [JsRender](https://www.jsviews.com/) or some totally new technology like [Svelte](https://svelte.dev).\r\n- [ ] Separate JavaScript code from HTML templates as much as possible.\r\n- [ ] Add tests for JavaScript model code. A precondition is deciding what test tool(s) to use.\r\n- [ ] Set up GitHub actions to run JavaScript tests.\r\n- [ ] Decide and document JavaScript coding conventions. Using an automated code formatter could be a good idea.\r\n- [ ] Take localization into account. See #3676.\r\n- [ ] Take accessibility into account.

Properly deprecating and eventually removing the latter simplifies the syntax.\r\n- Syntax like this requires special handling internally in Robot. Being able to remove it simplifies the code.\r\n- It has been already over 1.5 years since RF 5.0 was released. Users have had time to start taking `RETURN` into use.\r\n- Although using `[Return]` will case a deprecation warning, it will still continue to work during the whole RF 7.x lifetime.

This made sense earlier, because the `elapsedtime` attribute of our result model objects contained milliseconds as well, but as part of #4258 we now use `elapsed_time` that contains a `timedelta`. `timedelta` has microsecond precision and also directly support seconds with their `total_seconds()` method. Our utils working with milliseconds doesn't thus make much sense anymore.\r\n\r\nThe `elapsed_time_to_string` was already enhanced to accept the elapsed time as a `timedelta`, but I believe we should change it to consider ints/floats as seconds as well. Although it's unlikely this function is used outside our code base, that is certainly possible and just changing the behavior wouldn't be good. I thus believe we should deprecate the old behavior first. The problem is that the int/float value itself cannot tell should it be interpreted as seconds or milliseconds, so we need to add a new argument to control that. If the new argument is used, I believe it could be `seconds=True`, then the value is interpreted as seconds. If it's not used, we can interpret it as milliseconds and emit a deprecation warning.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4862/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4862/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4861","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4861/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4861/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4861/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4861","id":1888438803,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85wj0oT","number":4861,"title":"Remove

Lowest level ones are implemented in libraries using Python and higher level ones can be created using Robot's own syntax. We currently call these keywords \"library keywords\" and \"user keywords\", respectively. The former name is fine, it makes it clear that these keywords are implemented in libraries, but the latter name is a bit odd. Users creating tests may not have created \"user keywords\" they are using or they may have also created \"library keywords\".\r\n\r\nI believe that term \"compound keyword\" would be better than \"user keyword\". It doesn't concentrate on who has created the keyword, but instead makes it clear that the keyword is a combination of different parts. If others have even better ideas, please propose them in comments!\r\n\r\nThe main reason I believe we should change the term now is that as part of adding `start/end_keyword` methods to the listener API v3 (#3296), we are going to expose also model objects representing user/compound keywords. We probably need to add separate methods for them and I wouldn't like to add `start/end_user_keyword` if the term would be changed in the future. Adding `start/end_library_keyword` and `start/end_compound_keyword` sounds much better to me. In addition to the method name, the term will affect the names of the model objects.\r\n\r\nThis issues consists of the following tasks:\r\n- [ ] Agreeing on the term to use.\r\n- [ ] Updating the User Guide\r\n- [ ] Making sure existing public APIs use the new term in code and in documentation.\r\n\r\nNew public APIs obviously need to use the new term as well, but that is covered by their respective issues. Internal code can be updated when otherwise modified.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4848/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4848/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4847","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4847/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4847/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4847/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4847","id":1866809124,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85vRT8k","number":4847,"title":"Support JSON serialization with result model","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972225384,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4jaA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20large","name":"effort: large","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/64","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/64","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/64/labels","id":7828494,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Ad3QO","number":64,"title":"v7.0","description":"New major release supporting `start/end_keyword` methods with the listener API v3 (#3296), native syntax for creating local variables (#3761), variables without curly braces like `$name` (#4674) and various other interesting new features.

For example, `timedelta` should probably be converted to a float by using `timedelta.total_seconds()`. Also `date` could be converted to `datetime` that then would be handled automatically.\r\n- It's possible that with some types we should do some more formatting than just call `str()`.\r\n\r\nThe main motivation for this issues is making it easier for remote servers to convert values not supported by XML-RPC back to appropriate types.

This is rarely if ever useful. It would typically be enough to just use `--test y` to select that test.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it would more useful to be able to use `--suite x --test y` so that all tests in suite `x` are selected in addition to test `y`. Similarly, `--include x --test y` should mean selecting all tests containing tag `x` in addition to test `y`.\r\n\r\nThis change is backwards incompatible, but because the current behavior is pretty strange it's unlikely there are lot of problems. Changing the behavior in Robot Framework 7.0 ought to thus be fine. The plan is to change the behavior with `--suite` [also](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4688) [otherwise](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4720) and making all these changes in the same release would be good.\r\n\r\nAlthough these options should have a cumulative effect, we probably should interpret `--exclude` so that tests containing the specified tag aren't selected. That would preserve it's behavior when used with other options, most importantly with `--include`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**UPDATE:** We decided to keep the old `--suite` behavior. See the comment below for more details. Notice also that `--suite` not affecting which files are parsed was implemented already in RF 6.1

This is pretty inconsistent and needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nThe reason to requite `--test parent_name.test_name` to match the full suite name is that it makes it possible to explicitly pinpoint what test to run. If the name could match also partially, it could match also tests it shouldn't. For example Pabot relies on this functionality and it cannot be changed. If a partial match is needed, it's possible to use wildcards like `--test *.parent_name.test_name`.\r\n\r\nI don't remember there being any reason why `--suite parent_name.suite_name` should also support partial matches. To make `--test` and `--suite` behavior consistent, it ought to thus be ok to change how `--suite` behaves. The change is backwards incompatible but we can do it in Robot Framework 7.0. I doubt this functionality is used so often that it should be deprecated first.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4720/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4720/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4711","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4711/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4711/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4711/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4711","id":1647286008,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85iL5b4","number":4711,"title":"Support

The motivation for type aliases is to support types returned, for example, by dynamic libraries wrapping code using other languages. Such libraries can simply return type names as strings instead of mapping them to actual Python types.\r\n\r\nThere are two limitations with type aliases, though:\r\n- It isn't possible to represent types with nested types like `'list[int]'`. Aliases always map to a single concrete type, not to nested types.\r\n- Unions cannot be represented using \"Python syntax\" like `'int | float'`. It is possible to use a tuple like `('int', 'float')`, though, so this is mainly an inconvenience.\r\n\r\nImplementing this enhancement requires two things:\r\n- Support for parsing strings like `'list[int]'` and `'int | float'`. Results could be newish [TypeInfo](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/6e6f3a595d800ff43e792c4a7c582e7bf6abc131/src/robot/running/arguments/argumentspec.py#L183) objects that were added to make Libdoc handle nested types properly (#4538). Probably we could add a new `TypeInfo.from_string` class method.\r\n- Enhance type conversion to work with `TypeInfo`. Currently these objects are only used by Libdoc.\r\n\r\nIn addition to helping with libraries wrapping non-Python code, this enhancement would allow us to create argument converters based on Libdoc spec files. That would probably be useful for external tools such as editor plugins.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4711/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4711/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4710","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4710/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4710/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4710/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4710","id":1647274815,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85iL2s_","number":4710,"title":"Support library keywords with both embedded and normal arguments","user":{"login":"oianson","id":48958022,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjQ4OTU4MDIy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/48958022?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oianson","html_url":"https://github.com/oianson","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oianson/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oianson/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oianson/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oianson/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oianson/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oianson/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oianson/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oianson/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oianson/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972225384,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4jaA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20large","name":"effort: large","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/64","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/64","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/64/labels","id":7828494,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Ad3QO","number":64,"title":"v7.0","description":"New major release supporting `start/end_keyword` methods with the listener API v3 (#3296), native syntax for creating local variables (#3761), variables without curly braces like `$name` (#4674) and various other interesting new features.

Depending on the keyboard layout, writing them can also require annoying finger acrobatics. It would thus be convenient if it would be possible to use `$var` instead of `${var}` and also `@list`, `&dict` and `%env` instead of `@{list}`, `&{dict}` and `%{env}`. For example, all these could be supported:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n$VARIABLE        value\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Log    $VARIABLE\r\n    $var =    Keyword\r\n    FOR    $item    IN    @stuff\r\n        Log    $item\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn all the above cases the `$var` syntax is used on its own and that would work fine. This syntax wouldn't work too well when embedded to a string, though. For example, if you have variables `$name` and `$named`, string `Hello, $name!` could be parsed like `Hello, ${name}!`, but `abc$named` could be either `abc${name}d` or `abc${named}`. We could require using the `${var}` syntax in cases where `$var` is ambiguous, that's how [shell scripts](https://learn-bash.org/variables.html) work, but I believe it's better to require it always when variables are embedded. That makes the syntax more consistent and this approach is also considerably easier to implement. We can, however, look at this again later if the `$var` syntax is universally considered better and using it always (when possible) is considered important.\r\n\r\nSupporting the `$var` syntax would be a backwards incompatible change, but if we support it only when variables are used on their own, it shouldn't be that bad. It would mean that all arguments starting with `$`, `@`, `&` and `%` would need to be escaped like `\\$not_var`. We already require this with `#` (which otherwise starts a comment) so there's precedence for such syntax. Nevertheless, this would break lot of tests/tasks and the change can be made only in a major version. It would also be a good idea to deprecate using arguments starting with these characters already earlier. If this enhancement is considered important, it could be added in RF 7.0 and deprecation added in RF 6.2 or possibly already in RF 6.1.\r\n\r\nAlthough the basic syntax would be simple, there are some design decision to be made:\r\n\r\n1. Should we limit variable base name to only alpha numeric characters and underscore? In other words, should something like `$! als lkjas` be considered a variable with base name `! als lkjat` or should the whole thing be considered a literal string? Being more strict with the variable name would mean there's less need for escaping, but then these variables would work inconsistently compared to \"normal\" variables. It would also mean that some built-in variables like `${/}` couldn't be used like `$/`. I got a feeling that it's better if we don't limit the name. \r\n2. Should this syntax support item access like `$list[0]` and `$dict[key][nested]`? I believe it should.\r\n3. Should this syntax support \"extended variable syntax\" like `$var.upper()` and `$SPACE * 10`? I don't have too strong opinion on this, but I guess it would be better to support it. Needing to use `${var.upper()}` in this case would be a bit strange and inconsistent.\r\n\r\nI'll add this issue tentatively to RF 7.0 scope, but we still need to make a bit more official decision about it. If we decide to include it, then another issue should be submitted about deprecating arguments starting with `$` and other such variable meta characters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":4,"-1":2,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4667","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4667/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4667/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4667/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4667","id":1603524059,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85fk9Xb","number":4667,"title":"Remove

This means that the keyword may be called with a value that doesn't match the explicit custom pattern. That's not great and needs to be changed.\r\n\r\nWe initially planned to change this already in RF 6.0 (#4069), but it turned out that the change would cause too much backwards compatibility problems and the change was reverted. The main reason for backwards compatibility problems was that custom patterns were often used to resolve conflicts with various keyword implementations matching a keyword usage. Conflict resolution was enhanced heavily in RF 6.0 (#4454), so it is now safer to require patters to match also when using variables as embedded arguments.

Open terminal and create a test suite file `stuck.robot` with content\r\n```\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nMy Teardown\r\n    WHILE  True  limit=3\r\n        Log To Console  Sleep 1 second\r\n        Sleep  1\r\n    END\r\n\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nMy Test\r\n    No Operation\r\n    [Teardown]    My Teardown\r\n```\r\n2. Run test: `robot stuck.robot`\r\n\r\n### Actual results\r\nRobot output looks normal until while loop limit is reached:\r\n```\r\n==============================================================================\r\nStuck\r\n==============================================================================\r\nMy Test                                                               .Sleep 1 second\r\nSleep 1 second\r\nSleep 1 second\r\n```\r\nThen robot appears stuck. Host resource monitor indicates high CPU usage. It is possible to force exit by hitting `CTRL+C` more than once.\r\n\r\n### Reproducibility\r\nReproduced 10 times out of 10 on my local PC (first one in the list below).

suite, test or keyword documentation is split to multiple rows, rows are automatically joined together with a newline.

This can be fixed so that backslashes used for preventing newlines are removed from the documentation before rows are joined together.\r\n\r\nThis is a pretty annoying bug, but luckily there are very seldom needs to prevent the automatic newline. For example, in the above case the documentation in log and report looks exactly the same when formatted as a HTML paragraph. The main use case for splitting lines without an automatic newline is splitting strings that don't even have spaces in them and such strings are rare in documentation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4736/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4736/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4729","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4729/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4729/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4729/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4729","id":1659823987,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85i7udz","number":4729,"title":"Leading

execution just some tests from a big directory structure, parsing only relevant files instead of the whole structure makes parsing faster. We don't currently have any explicit option for limiting parsing like that, but when the `--suite` option is used files not matching the specified suite are ignored. This functionality won't work too well in the future, though, if we make it possible to change the suite name using the `Name` setting (#4583). It's also likely that not too many users know about this functionality and the underlying logic to convert file and directory names to suite names for matching purposes is also rather complicated.\r\n\r\nA good way to solve all the above problems is adding a separate command line option or options for controlling what files to parse. Once we have such functionality, we can remove the current performance optimization from `--suite`, a separate option makes the feature easier to discover, and also the code gets simpler. There are some design decisions to be made, though:\r\n\r\n- What should the option be named? I was thinking `--includefiles`, but it has the same prefix as `--include` which would mean that shortened usages like `--incl` that used to be unique wouldn't work anymore. Perhaps `--parsefiles` or just `--files` would be better.\r\n- Should the value be a literal value or should we accept glob patterns? I believe supporting patterns is a good idea.\r\n- Should the value be just a file name or a relative or absolute path to it? I see benefits with both so possibly we could support both usages.\r\n- Should the value include file extension? I believe it should be allowed but preferably not required. If that gets too complicated, always requiring it is probably better.\r\n- Should there be separate option for excluding files? It would make some use cases easier, but I'm not sure is that worth the added complexity.\r\n- Should this option affect only files or also directories? If the option would match a directory, we could automatically include all files under it, recursively. On the other hand, just matching files would be easier to implement and explain.\r\n- Should we have separate options for matching files and directories? That's probably too much, especially if we'd have separate options for including and excluding. If directories are considered important, probably better to implement this so that the same option work with both files and directories.\r\n\r\nThis feature should be implemented before RF 7 where we'd like to change `--suite` so that it doesn't affect parsing. That would give users who need the performance optimization time to update their scripts.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4687/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4684","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4684/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4684/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4684/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4684","id":1621310061,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85gozpt","number":4684,"title":"Handle

added support for the optional start index in RF 4.0 (#3781). It was implemented so that only the runner object detected that the last iterated value has `start=` prefix and the parser doesn't know anything about it. When similar configuration was added to `WHILE` (`limit`) and `EXCEPT` (`type`), they were already recognized by the parser making the behavior with `start` inconsistent. This should be changed and `start` with `FOR IN ENUMERATE` loops handled by the parser as well.\r\n\r\nHandling `start` in the parser means that the `For` model object in the `TestSuite` structure needs `start` attribute as well. The same `For` is used with all `FOR` loop types and it getting an attribute that only affects one of them is a bit questionable, but I don't consider it too big a problem. We could consider adding separate `ForInEnumerate`, `ForInRange` and `ForInZip` model object, but I consider that too much work compared to benefits at least right now. We also need to add `start` as an attribute to `output.xml`. Changing it always has backwards incompatibility concerns, but tools processing XML files shouldn't be bothered by new attributes so I consider this safe.\r\n\r\nOne reason to do this is that we plan to make `FOR IN ZIP` configurable as well. It's configuration options should definitely be handled by the parser and in that case `FOR IN ENUMERATE` behaving differently would be really weird.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4684/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683","id":1621271832,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85goqUY","number":4683,"title":"Report

when you have an invalid setting like `[Setpu]` in a test (or keyword, or task), error is reported on the console, but the test is nevertheless executed and in the log file the invalid setting isn't visible under the test at all. This isn't great. It would be better if the invalid setting would be visible under the test in the log file and it should also fail the test.\r\n\r\nA similar situation occurs with invalid syntax like `END` or `ELSE` without an opening `IF`. At the moment such invalid syntax is considered to be a keyword. We have `Reserved` library that contains matching keywords, so when these \"keywords\" are run they fail. Invalid syntax reported as failing keywords is odd and the resulting error messages aren't great either. A part of #4210 is detecting this kind of invalid syntax already at the parsing time, but we need to also show them in the log file somehow.\r\n\r\nA solution to both of these error reporting issues is adding new `Error` object to our `TestSuite` structure. When the parser detects invalid syntax, it can create such objects, and when they are run they can simply fail. These errors should create new `<error>` elements to output.xml and they obviously need to be show in log.html as well.\r\n\r\nA problem with this enhancement is that it's not fully backwards compatible:\r\n- Invalid settings like `[Setpu]` don't currently affect test status, but in the future they will fail the test. An obvious solution for this kind of problem is not having such invalid settings in tests in the first place.\r\n- External tools parsing output.xml need to take `<error>` elements into account. In general such tools should ignore elements they don't recognize, but there certainly can be tools that don't behave like that.\r\n- Tools working with the `TestSuite` model need to take new `Error` objects into account.\r\n\r\nInvalid syntax failing a test isn't a big concern for me, but this change possibly breaking external tools is a lot bigger problem. I don't see any other ways this could be handed, though. Doing the change in a non-major version is a bit questionable, but I don't think postponing this change to RF 7 (or changing RF 6.1 to RF 7) is a good idea either. We just need to inform external tool developers about this change in release notes and possibly also otherwise.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682","id":1620330369,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85glEeB","number":4682,"title":"Make

`FOR IN ZIP` loop behaves like Python's  [zip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) so that if lists lengths aren't the same, items from the longest one are ignored. For example, the following loop would be executed only twice:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n@{ANIMALS}    dog      cat    horse    cow    elephant\r\n@{ELÄIMET}    koira    kissa\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    FOR    ${en}    ${fi}    IN ZIP    ${ANIMALS}    ${ELÄIMET}\r\n        Log    ${en} is ${fi} in Finnish\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior can cause problems when iterating over items received from the automated system. For example, the following test would pass regardless how many things `Get something` returns as long as the returned items match the expected values. The example even succeeds if `Get something` nothing.\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Validate something    expected 1    expected 2    expected 3\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ****\r\nValidate something\r\n    [Arguments]    @{expected}\r\n    @{actual} =    Get something\r\n    FOR    ${act}    ${exp}    IN ZIP    ${actual}    ${expected}\r\n        Validate one thing    ${act}    ${exp}\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo avoid the above example failing if `Get something` returns more or less values than expected, a separate check needs to be added. Because there's no ready-made keyword for checking are list lengths equal (`Lists should be equal` keyword doesn't work here), the validation needs to use something bit more complicated like this:\r\n```\r\n    Should be equal    ${{len($actual)}}    ${{len($expected)}}\r\n```\r\nFor a real life example see [this example](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/f7ee913622e60c0cf630e1580c2bb58c57100187/atest/robot/running/if/invalid_if.robot#L119) from out acceptance tests. Tests also contain various `FOR IN ZIP` usages where this particular issue could cause problems.\r\n\r\nThis same underlying issues has caused problems with Python's `zip` as well. Starting from Python 3.10 (see [PEP 619](https://peps.python.org/pep-0618/) `zip` has new `strict` parameter that can be used like `zip(actual, expected, strict=True)`. It causes a `ValueError` to be raised if iterated lists have different lengths. Related to this, Python also has separate [itertools.zip_longest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest) that goes through all items in all lists so that if certain list has less value than others, value specified with the `fillvalue` argument is used instead.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that we add new `mode` configuration option to `FOR IN ZIP` loops. The motivation is that we could have three values `shortest`, `strict` and `longest` emulating Python's behavior with `zip(...)`, `zip(..., strict=True=`), and `zip_longest(...)`, respectively. This was also [considered with Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0618/#add-several-modes-to-switch-between), but they decided to go with a Boolean option `strict` partly because they already have a separate `zip_longest`.\r\n\r\nAnother reason `mode` wasn't used with Python is that to properly support the `longest` case, it would require adding `fillvalue` that doesn't make sense with other modes. That's a valid concern in our case as well, but I don't consider it too big a problem. We don't at the moment support the `longest` case at all, so this would instead be a nice enhancement and a lot better syntax than separate `FOR IN ZIP LONGEST` would be.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680","id":1620223756,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85gkqcM","number":4680,"title":"User

common error when evaluating expressions with IF or otherwise is using something like\r\n```\r\nIF    ${x} == 'expected'\r\n    Keyword\r\nEND\r\n```\r\nwhen the variable `${x}` contains a string. Normal variables are resolved _before_ evaluating the expression, so if `${x}` contains a string `value`, the evaluated expression will be `value == 'expected'`. Evaluating it fails because `value` isn't quoted, it's thus considered a variable in Python, and no such variable exists. The resulting error is this:\r\n\r\n> Evaluating IF condition failed: Evaluating expression 'value == 'expected'' failed: NameError: name 'value' is not defined nor importable as module\r\n\r\nOne solution to this problem is quoting the variable like `'${x}' == 'expected'`, but that doesn't work if the variable value contains quotes or newlines. A better solution is using the special `$var` syntax like `$x == 'value'` that makes the variable available in the Python evaluation namespace (#2040). All this is explained in the [User Guide](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#evaluating-expressions), but there are many users who don't know about this and struggle with the syntax.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a such a common error, we should make the error more informative if the expression contains \"normal\" variables. We could, for example, show also the original expression and recommend quoting or using the \"special\" variable syntax. Possibly it could look like this:\r\n\r\n> Evaluating IF condition failed: Evaluating expression 'value == 'expected'' failed: NameError: name 'value' is not defined nor importable as module\r\n> The original expression was '${x} == 'expected''. Try using the '$var' syntax like '$x == 'expected'' to avoid resolving variables before the expression is evaluated. See the Evaluating expression appendix in the User Guide for more details.\r\n\r\nThere are few problems implementing this:\r\n1. Variables are solved before the [evaluate_expression](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/src/robot/variables/evaluation.py#L31) is called so this function doesn't know the original expression nor did it contain variables. This information needs to be passed to it, but in same cases (at least with inline Python evaluation) it isn't that easy.\r\n2. It's not easy to detect when exactly this extra information should be included into the error. Including it always when evaluating the expression fails can add confusion when the error isn't related to variables. It would probably better to include it only if evaluation fails for a NameError, but also in that case you could have an expression like `'${x}' == value` where the variable likely isn't a problem. We could try some heuristics to see what causes the error, but that's probably too much work compared to including the extra info in some cases where it's not needed.\r\n3. Coming up with a good but somewhat short error message isn't easy. I'm not totally happy with the above, but I guess it would be better than nothing.\r\n\r\nBecause this extra info is added only if evaluation fails, this should be a totally backwards compatible change. It would be nice to include it already into RF 6.1, but that release is already about to be late and this isn't that easy to implement, so RF 6.2 is probably a better target. If someone is interested to look at this, including it already into RF 6.1 ought to be possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4676/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670","id":1609324383,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85f7Fdf","number":4670,"title":"Parsing

This builder only works with suite files and not with resource files. The `LibraryDocumentation` factory method that uses `DocumentationBuilder` handles this problem internally similarly as it handles `DocumentationBuilder` not supporting resource files in PYTHONPATH so this doesn't affect Libdoc itself. It does, however, affect direct usage of `DocumentationBuilder`.\r\n\r\nChanges like this are always annoying, but in this case this isn't too severe because `DocumentationBuilder` isn't really part of the public API and `LibraryDocumentation` should be used instead of it. Alternatively, it's possible to use `ResourceDocBuilder` explicitly when working with resource files. The initial plan was to just document this behavior (#4517), but it is actually easy to fix this by making `DocumentationBuilder` a class instead of a factory method.\r\n\r\nA related problem is that Libdoc's public API isn't properly defined. A separate issue needs to be submitted about that. We can then explicitly recommend `LibraryDocumentation`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516","id":1424167138,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85U4xDi","number":4516,"title":"`Set

Analysis showed that the time was taken by calls to the Built in keyword `Keyword should exist`. In that particular situation it could take more than a second for a single call to `Keyword should exist` to return, with an average of 400ms. Anything above 500ms was causing failures.\r\n\r\nFurther analysis revealed the time to be spend on finding keyword recommendations. Finding these recommendations is a very useful feature when you misspell a keyword during test case development. However, when explicitly checking for a keyword's existence at runtime, the boolean answer suffices. In fact, in the current implementation the recommendations are disposed and not included in the reported failure.\r\n\r\nA proposed solution is available in

New issue (#4454) was submitted about enhancing conflict resolution the problematic regexps explained in the aforementioned comment wouldn't be needed.\r\n\r\nImproved conflict resolution works well and will be part of RF 5.1, but it is still not safe to make custom regexp validation more strict.

A solution to this problem, recommended in the [User Guide](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#using-custom-regular-expressions), has been using custom patterns that limit what keywords match. For example, changing the first keyword to `Execute \"${command:[^\"]+}\"` would mitigate the issue.\r\n\r\nIssue #4069 proposes making custom patterns more strict so that they would be validated also when the argument is given as a variable. As the comment referenced above explains, this unfortunately causes problems if patterns have been used for resolving conflicts as explained above.\r\n\r\nA solution to the problem caused by conflicts, that would also allow us making custom pattern validation more strict, would be Robot somehow being able to detect what is the \"best\" match. For a human it is pretty clear that if you use `Execute \"x\" on device \"y\"`, `Execute \"${command}\" on device \"${device}\"` matches better than `Execute \"${command}\"`, but the problem is how Robot can detect that. It's also a question that can it always detect it right or could there be false positives. I have one pretty simple approach in mind that I explain in a separate comment.

For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef my_keyword(time: timedelta) -> float:\r\n    return time.total_seconds()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill fail cleanly during runtime if user tries to pass something incompatible like a list:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: Argument 'time' got value '[1]' (list) that cannot be converted to timedelta.\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'total_seconds'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this validation only exists for [supported types](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/5.0/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#supported-conversions) and types that has user defined [custom converters](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/5.0/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#custom-argument-converters).\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nAs discussed in issue #3690 backwards compatibility limits us for enabling type guarding on default. One option would be adding a library level toggle but having too many options in `@library` is not desirable either.\r\n\r\nOther option would be adding a special [custom converter](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/5.0/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#custom-argument-converters) that only validates that argument [is instance](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance) of the type. For example like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nROBOT_LIBRARY_CONVERTERS = {\r\n    CustomType1: None,\r\n    CustomType2: None\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `None` would be a shortcut for this pattern:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _typechecked(_):\r\n    raise ValueError()\r\n\r\nROBOT_LIBRARY_CONVERTERS = {\r\n    CustomType1: _typechecked,\r\n    CustomType2: _typechecked\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more implementation details see this [comment](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3690#issuecomment-1220547740).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4440/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438","id":1341473874,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85P9URS","number":4438,"title":"`Get Time` returns current time if it is given input time that matches epoch","user":{"login":"spu06th","id":19752636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzUyNjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19752636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th","html_url":"https://github.com/spu06th","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":230194541,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzAxOTQ1NDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/beta%202","name":"beta 2","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v6.0","description":"New main release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

The main reason the singular form has ever been supported than in the early days Robot's data was in HTML tables and tables typically had headers like in this example:\r\n\r\n| Test Case | Keyword | Argument | Argument |\r\n| -- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\r\n| Example | Log | Message |   |\r\n\r\nNowadays there are no concrete benefits in supporting both header formats. There are, however, some drawbacks:\r\n- Supporting multiple formats like this makes the overall syntax a bit more complicated to learn and for external tools to support.\r\n- It makes translation effort (#4390) a bit bigger.\r\n- As pointed out in [this comment](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4390#issuecomment-1213425595) to #4390, some languages support also a [dual form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_(grammatical_number)) that we should support if we support both singular and plural forms.\r\n\r\nAdding support for the dual form wouldn't be a big task, but it would make the overall syntax even more complicated. A much simpler solution is supporting only the plural form. We can consider the section header like `Test Cases` to indicate that \"below this header we have tests\" and it works fine regardless how many tests there actually are. We have thus made a decision to:\r\n\r\n- support only the plural form with translations (covered by #4390), and\r\n- remove the support for singular form with English.\r\n\r\nWe obviously cannot just remove the support of singular headers in RF 5.1 because the change would be backwards incompatible. These are the steps we are planning to take instead:\r\n\r\n1. Document that singular headers are deprecated in RF 5.1 release notes and in the User Guide. No visible deprecation warning yet. This is covered by this issue.\r\n2. Start emitting deprecation warnings. This can earliest be done in RF 6.0, but we don't have too big hurry and waiting for 7.0 might be better. This is covered by #4432.\r\n3. Actually remove the support for singular headers. This can earliest be the next major release after the one where they are visibly deprecated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429","id":1336868939,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85PrwBL","number":4429,"title":"Allow passing flags to regexp related keywords using explicit `flags` argument","user":{"login":"oboehmer","id":22439451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM5NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22439451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer","html_url":"https://github.com/oboehmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":219378453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTkzNzg0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/beta%201","name":"beta 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""},{"id":911065884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MTEwNjU4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/acknowledge","name":"acknowledge","color":"bc82e0","default":false,"description":"To be acknowledged in release notes"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v6.0","description":"New main release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.
