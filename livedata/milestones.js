currently have our own `get_timestamp` function for getting the current timestamp and `get_elapsed_time` for calculating the difference between two timestamps as milliseconds.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> t1 = get_timestamp()\r\n>>> t2 = get_timestamp()\r\n>>> print(t1)\r\n20220308 12:37:43.875\r\n>>> print(t2)\r\n20220308 12:37:49.022\r\n>>> get_elapsed_time(t1, t2)\r\n5147\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should replace these custom functions with functionality provided by Python's standard [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) module. In practice we could get the current time by using `datetime.now()` and could calculate the elapsed time by simply subtracting `datetime` objects:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> d1 = datetime.now()\r\n>>> d2 = datetime.now()\r\n>>> print(d1)\r\n2022-03-08 12:43:56.109349\r\n>>> print(d2)\r\n2022-03-08 12:44:03.567573\r\n>>> delta = d2 - d1\r\n>>> round(delta.total_seconds() * 1000)\r\n7458\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne benefit of using the standard `datetime` module would be that we could remove lot of our custom code. A bigger benefit is performance measured here using [timeit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html):\r\n```python\r\n>>> timeit(lambda: get_timestamp())\r\n1.0487582740024664\r\n>>> timeit(lambda: datetime.now())\r\n0.2848877740034368\r\n>>> timeit(lambda: get_elapsed_time(t1, t2))\r\n5.105318886999157\r\n>>> timeit(lambda: round((d2-d1).total_seconds() * 1000))\r\n0.24636966099205893\r\n```\r\nAs can seen from the examples, the difference in performance is pretty big when getting the timestamp and rather huge when calculating the elapsed time. These tests each run one million iterations, so the time for one iteration isn't huge and this doesn't matter much with smallish test/task runs. With bigger runs containing e.g. loops times start to add, though, because we call `get_timestamp` twice and `get_elapsed_time` once for each keyword, loop iteration, IF/ELSE branch, and so on.

That has worked very well, and it would be nice if something like that would work also with variables defined in test data. We probably could re-use the underlying argument conversion logic which ought to make it relatively easy to implement this. We also got a similar request related to variables passed from the command line #2946.\r\n\r\nAutomatically converting numbers like `42` and `3.14` to actual integers/floats would be handy, even when we already support them as variables like `${42}` and `${3.14}`. Being able to use datatime objects, bytes, and other types supported by the argument conversion that don't have direct variable alternatives would naturally be even more useful (but also less commonly needed). I would expect this to be most useful with lists and dictionaries and especially with nested list and dicts that cannot easily be constructed in Robot's data.\r\n\r\nMy proposed syntax for this functionality is supporting \"type postfix\" like `:int` in variable names like this:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${COUNT:int}         42\r\n${GOOD IDEA:bool}    Yes    # Converted to Boolean True\r\n${ANIMALS:list}      ['cat', 'dog', 'horse']    # Python syntax\r\n${NESTED:dict}       {'a': 1, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}    # Great with JSON\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax is derived from Python's function annotation syntax and also the same syntax that was decided to be used with command line variables in #2946. Variable names would naturally be created without the type prefix like `${COUNT}` and `${GOOD IDEA}`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being available in the variable section, the new syntax should also be available also when creating variable otherwise, including in keyword arguments:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nExample\r\n    [Arguments]    ${count:int}\r\n    ${nested:dict} =    Set Variable    {'a': ${count}, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}\r\n    Set Test Variable    ${DATE:datetime}     2019-08-23 12:03:42\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are some design decision still to be made like should `${X:dict}` create a `DotDict` instance that allows `${X.key}` syntax and how to handle possible backwards incompatibility issues. For most parts the design looks pretty good, though, and I think this would be a valuable addition to Robot Framework. If there's enough interest, we can consider adding this already to RF 3.2 scope.

It would allow using keywords in places where currently you'd normally just have plain strings (or variables). Example usages are listed below and possible syntax alternatives discussed in separate comments.\r\n\r\n1. Arguments to other keywords. At the moment you need to this in two steps:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   ${result} =    Keyword    argument\r\n   Another Keyword    ${result}\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   In Python and other \"real\" programming languages you use something like `another_keyword(keyword('argument'))`, but in Robot's syntax\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   Another Keyword    Keyword    argument\r\n   ```\r\n   is parsed as `Another Keyword` getting two arguments. This cannot be changed so new syntax is needed.\r\n\r\n2. Condition to the forthcoming `IF/ELSE` syntax (#3074).

Similarly existing FOR loops would benefit from this.\r\n\r\n4. Inline keyword call syntax would also allow adding support to create variables in the `Variables` section based on keyword return values. Currently that's not possible at all, and creating suite level variables dynamically requires using Suite Setup.

The whole system to set tags for tests with `Force Tags`, `Default Tags` and `[Tags]` is somewhat complicated and issue #4365 proposes simplifying it so that `Force Tags` is renamed to `Test Tags` and `Default Tags` is removed altogether. I believe simplifying the syntax is a good idea, but I understand there are still sometimes cases where specifying tags that most tests have but some don't would be convenient.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that we'd make it possible to use `-tag` syntax with tests that want to opt out from tags set globally. Basically that would change current\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nForce Tags      all\r\nDefault Tags    most\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nT1\r\n    No Operation\r\nT2\r\n    [Tags]    one\r\n    No Operation\r\nT3\r\n    No Operation\r\n```\r\nto\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nTest Tags      all    most\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nT1\r\n    No Operation\r\nT2\r\n    [Tags]    one    -most\r\n    No Operation\r\nT3\r\n    No Operation\r\n```\r\nI actually consider the above easier to understand the original with strange `Force Tags` and `Default Tags` settings.\r\n\r\nThe major benefit of this syntax would be that it would work also with the proposed `Keyword Tags` setting (#4373). Regardless do we remove `Default Tags` or not, I don't think it makes sense to add something like `Default Keyword Tags` in addition to `Keyword Tags`, but this would work just fine:\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nKeywords Tags      all    most\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nK1\r\n    No Operation\r\nK2\r\n    [Tags]    one    -most\r\n    No Operation\r\nK3\r\n    No Operation\r\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4374/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4374/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4304","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4304/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4304/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4304/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4304","id":1196078189,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85HSrRt","number":4304,"title":"New technology for Libdoc HTML outputs","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/65","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/65","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/65/labels","id":8098814,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Ae5P-","number":65,"title":"v5.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":14,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2022-06-20T15:09:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T22:25:18Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2022-04-07T13:47:55Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T12:47:32Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Libdoc HTML outputs, similarly as log.html and report.html, use [jQuery Templates](https://github.com/BorisMoore/jquery-tmpl) for generating HTML content based on the date embedded to the outputs when they are created by Libdoc.

Now all the syntax there (and more!) has been added so there's no need to reserve anything. When we added `IF` in RF 4.0, we also made a decision to require all this kind of syntax to be upper case.

It must be an upper case 'IF' when used as a marker.`, the new error isn't as informative as earlier. I would say we can nowadays expect users to know that this kind of syntax must be upper case so this isn't a big deal.

It is possible to use `BuiltIn.run_keyword` to execute other keywords so that they are shown as child keywords and #4237 discusses better APIs for that usage.\r\n\r\nA problem with using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` is that keywords executed with it must be available as normal keywords either in the library running other keywords or in some other imported library. That's ok if keywords are usable on their own, but it is possible that child keywords cannot be used like that. This problem can be avoided by making it possible to run any callable as the [final proposal](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237#issuecomment-1058077142) in #4237 suggests. There could, however, be even better solutions for the underlying need.\r\n\r\nA solution I have been thinking is is using a context manager that would create a keyword in log (and in output.xml).

No need to expose child keywords as real keywords.\r\n2. No need to even make each child keyword a callable. Implementation could be directly inside the context manager.\r\n3. It would be possible to add documentation, tags, etc. to be shown in the log file.\r\n\r\nPoints 1. and 3. would be possible also with `execute_keyword` proposed in #4237. Executing other keywords has also other use cases than logging child keywords, so #4237 is likely needed anyway. It's not certain is 2. alone worth enough to implement this feature.

One good example is SeleniumLibrary, that makes it possible to register a keyword that will be executed if any of its own keywords fails. Sometimes, especially when doing task automation, it is also beneficial to log actions done by the keyword in the log file separately. For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing()\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords, but there are sometimes needs to show `do_first_thing` and `do_second_thing` as child keywords.\r\n\r\nNowadays keywords can execute other keywords by using `BuiltIn.run_keyword`. It works but has several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Arguments are resolved twice. This  means replacing variables and handling syntax like `\\n`. For example, if we have a keyword like\r\n    ```python\r\n    def example(arg):\r\n        BuiltIn().run_keyword('Log To Console', arg)\r\n    ```\r\n    and call it like\r\n    ```\r\n    Example    c:\\\\temp\r\n    ```\r\n    the actually logged string has a tab character. The reason is that `\\\\t` is first resolved to string `\\t` which is then on the second round resolved to a tab.\r\n\r\n    Double resolving can be avoided be registering the keyword to be a \"run keyword variant\", but that API isn't really public and it's also pretty bad in general. We have #2190 about enhancing it and making it public, but it would probably be better to avoid this double resolving altogether.\r\n\r\n2. Related to above, the keyword using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` cannot safely call it without escaping strings. For example, something like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Log To Console', 'c:\\\\temp')` won't work correctly and the argument should be `c:\\\\\\\\temp` instead.\r\n\r\n3. `BuiltIn.run_keyword` only accepts positional arguments. For example, if we had a keyword implemented like\r\n    ```pyhton\r\n    def example(upper=False):\r\n        ...\r\n    ```\r\n    we couldn't call it like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Example', upper=True)` but instead needed to use `BuiltIn.run_keywod('Example', 'upper=True')`.\r\n\r\nThe above examples ought to make it clear that a better API is needed. I have some ideas how to API could look and will write separate comments about that a bit later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4234","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4234/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4234/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4234/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4234","id":1139037342,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85D5FSe","number":4234,"title":"Supporting embedded arguments mixed with normal arguments","user":{"login":"JockeJarre","id":12571104,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNTcxMTA0","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12571104?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/JockeJarre","html_url":"https://github.com/JockeJarre","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JockeJarre/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JockeJarre/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JockeJarre/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JockeJarre/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JockeJarre/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JockeJarre/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JockeJarre/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JockeJarre/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/JockeJarre/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/65","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/65","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/65/labels","id":8098814,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Ae5P-","number":65,"title":"v5.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":14,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2022-06-20T15:09:49Z","updated_at":"2022-09-13T22:25:18Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":11,"created_at":"2022-02-15T18:05:52Z","updated_at":"2022-06-30T20:51:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"CONTRIBUTOR","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"it could be useful to support embedded arguments mixed with normal arguments\r\n\r\n```robot\r\nNumber of ${animals} should be\r\n    [Arguments]    ${count}\r\n    #

A problem with detecting errors only at the execution time is that they aren't reported to tools like editor plugins that use Robot's parser. We should thus move error detection to parser as much as possible. This includes at least these cases:\r\n\r\n- Empty test and keyword.\r\n- `END`, `ELSE`, `ELSE IF`, `EXCEPT` or `FINALLY` when there is no matching parent element like `IF` or `TRY`.\r\n- ~`RETURN` used in test.~ Fixed already in RF 5.0.\r\n- ~`BREAK/CONTINUE` outside loops.~ Fixed already in RF 5.0.\r\n- ~`RETURN/BREAK/CONTINUE` in `FINALLY`.~ Fixed already in RF 5.0.\r\n\r\nWe also have a similar problem that some of the error situations detected by the parser are not detected as early as they could be. For example, having `IF` with more than one condition is detected by the parser when the parsing model is validated, but the underlying tokens do not get `ERROR` type. This is a problem if only using tokens (i.e. when using `get_tokens`, not `get_model`) and also when using the model it would be more convenient if invalid tokens could be easily detected. This problem occurs at least in these cases:\r\n\r\n- `IF`, `ELSE IF` and `WHILE` with more than one condition.\r\n- `ELSE`, `END`, `BREAK`, `CONTINUE`, `TRY` and `FINALLY` with values.\r\n- `AS` with invalid variable or with more than one variable.\r\n\r\nBecause these latter errors are detected by the parser, only a bit late, I don't consider this limitation as bad as the problem with the earlier errors.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4210/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170","id":1080815625,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Aa_AJ","number":4170,"title":"Tests

A solution to this problem, recommended in the [User Guide](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#using-custom-regular-expressions), has been using custom patterns that limit what keywords match. For example, changing the first keyword to `Execute \"${command:[^\"]+}\"` would mitigate the issue.\r\n\r\nIssue #4069 proposes making custom patterns more strict so that they would be validated also when the argument is given as a variable. As the comment referenced above explains, this unfortunately causes problems if patterns have been used for resolving conflicts as explained above.\r\n\r\nA solution to the problem caused by conflicts, that would also allow us making custom pattern validation more strict, would be Robot somehow being able to detect that is the \"best\" match. For a human it is pretty clear that if you use `Execute \"x\" on device \"y\"`, `Execute \"${command}\" on device \"${device}\"` matches better than `Execute \"${command}\"`, but the problem is how Robot can detect that. It's also a question that can it always detect it right or could there be false positives. I have one pretty simple approach in mind that I explain in a separate comment. Other approaches can also be proposed!","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4454/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4454/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4453","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4453/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4453/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4453/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4453","id":1364120796,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85RTtTc","number":4453,"title":"`Run Keywords`: Execution is not continued in teardown if keyword name contains non-existing variable","user":{"login":"peerasut","id":68002612,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MDAyNjEy","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68002612?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/peerasut","html_url":"https://github.com/peerasut","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peerasut/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peerasut/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peerasut/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peerasut/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peerasut/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peerasut/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peerasut/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peerasut/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/peerasut/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430514,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA1MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20low","name":"priority: low","color":"41ae76","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v5.1","description":"New feature release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

The main reason the singular form has ever been supported than in the early days Robot's data was in HTML tables and tables typically had headers like in this example:\r\n\r\n| Test Case | Keyword | Argument | Argument |\r\n| -- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\r\n| Example | Log | Message |   |\r\n\r\nNowadays there are no concrete benefits in supporting both header formats. There are, however, some drawbacks:\r\n- Supporting multiple formats like this makes the overall syntax a bit more complicated to learn and for external tools to support.\r\n- It makes translation effort (#4390) a bit bigger.\r\n- As pointed out in [this comment](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4390#issuecomment-1213425595) to #4390, some languages support also a [dual form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_(grammatical_number)) that we should support if we support both singular and plural forms.\r\n\r\nAdding support for the dual form wouldn't be a big task, but it would make the overall syntax even more complicated. A much simpler solution is supporting only the plural form. We can consider the section header like `Test Cases` to indicate that \"below this header we have tests\" and it works fine regardless how many tests there actually are. We have thus made a decision to:\r\n\r\n- support only the plural form with translations (covered by #4390), and\r\n- remove the support for singular form with English.\r\n\r\nWe obviously cannot just remove the support of singular headers in RF 5.1 because the change would be backwards incompatible. These are the steps we are planning to take instead:\r\n\r\n1. Document that singular headers are deprecated in RF 5.1 release notes and in the User Guide. No visible deprecation warning yet.

This is validated using our `is_dict_like` that simply does `isinstance(obj, Mapping)`.\r\n\r\nObjects used with these keywords obviously should be dictionaries or dictionary-like, but it is possible to create dictionary-like objects that don't inherit `Mapping`. For example, our XML library tests were affected by this because [lxml.etree._Attrib](https://bugs.launchpad.net/lxml/+bug/1981760) wasn't a mapping. I added a workaround for that problem to our code (first in 255f0fa2e013cd86419520755f6651311e9370f4, then enhanced in 4e226582f53fd97b28a3979131e58ebd489caa8b) and the bug has been fixed also on the lxml side.\r\n\r\nI would say having a dictionary-like object that isn't a `Mapping` is always a bug, but as the lxml example demonstrates it is certainly possible that such code exists. It is also possible that not all projects are as fast to react as lxml was.\r\n\r\nBecause this change is backwards incompatible, it's a bit questionable is it a good idea in a non-major release or in general. The reason I think the change is fine is that we are equally strict that values are lists or list-like with list related keywords. It's also easy to register dictionary-objects as mappings like our workaround (and also the actual fix) for the lxml problem does. Anyway, if there are problems caused by this change we can consider reverting it or changing the code so that non-Mappings are still accepted but there's a deprecation warning.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4413/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4413/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4411","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4411/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4411/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4411/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4411","id":1307857719,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85N9FM3","number":4411,"title":"Section header translations are unnecessarily required to be in title case","user":{"login":"MoreFamed","id":82573620,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjgyNTczNjIw","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/82573620?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed","html_url":"https://github.com/MoreFamed","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/MoreFamed/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":110430429,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA0Mjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/task","name":"task","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Generic task not listed in release notes"},{"id":178145936,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzgxNDU5MzY=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/alpha%202","name":"alpha 2","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v5.1","description":"New feature release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

Currently if you have a test like\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    [Tags]    robot:continue-on-failure\r\n    [Setup]     Setup Keyword\r\n    Keyword In Body\r\n    Another Keyword\r\n```\r\nand the `Setup Keyword` fails, keywords in the test body aren't run. That can be considered inconsistent because continue-on-failure mode is explicitly enabled, but I actually like this behavior. You can have some action in setup so that execution ends if it fails, but keywords in the body that are validating that everything went as expected would all be run if the setup succeeds. This would also add some new functionality to setups that are otherwise not really different from normal keywords.\r\n\r\nWhat do others (especially @oboehmer) think about this? Should we stop execution after a failing setup also when continue-on-failure mode is on? If yes, we just need to add some tests for the current behavior and mention this in the User Guide. If not, then we need to change the code as well.\r\n\r\nA problem with changing the code is that the change would be backwards incompatible.

These include:\r\n- `robot:continue-on-failure` and `robot:recursive-continue-on-failure` in RF 4.1 (#2285)\r\n- `robot:exclude`, `robot:skip`, and `robot:skip-on-failure` in RF 5.0 (#4161)\r\n- `robot:stop-on-failure` and `robot:recursive-stop-on-failure` in RF 5.1 (#4303)\r\n- `robot:private` in RF 5.1 (#430)\r\n\r\nAll these tags provide valuable functionality, but checking do keywords have these tags adds some overhead. The reason there's overhead is that when we use something like `robot:private in keyword.tags`, this code ends up calling `Tags.match()` that is very generic and handles things like normalization before matching, support for patterns (e.g. `example: *`) and Boolean expressions (e.g. `tag1 OR tag2`). The overhead isn't _that_ big, but it adds up if there are lot of keywords. Many of these tags affect the behavior if there's a failure, so there's especially big overhead if there are lot of keywords that fail.\r\n\r\nLuckily having a big amount of failing keywords isn't a too common situation, but it is easy to demonstrate this with a loop and, for example, a TRY/EXCEPT structure. As issue #4053 demonstrates, the extra overhead has caused problems also in practice. That issue was reported when we had added `robot:continue-on-failure` and with all the newer tags the situation is likely somewhat worse.\r\n\r\nTo avoid these useful tags slowing down execution, we should handle the special `robot:<name>` tags better. We should check for them when creating `Tags` objects (could be done as part of normalizing tags) so that we can then query for them using some other approach than the generic `Tags.match()`.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4388/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4388/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4387","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4387/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4387/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4387/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4387","id":1293241871,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85NFU4P","number":4387,"title":"Libdoc: Fix storing information about deprecated keywords to spec files","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":175630288,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzU2MzAyODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/alpha%201","name":"alpha 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v5.1","description":"New feature release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

In practice this example would work without a warning and the test will get tags `-example`, `-another` and `-third`:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nTest Tags        -example\r\n\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${TAG}           -another\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    [Tags]    \\-third    ${TAG}\r\n    Keyword\r\n```\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4380/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4380/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4379","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4379/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4379/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4379/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4379","id":1280125848,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85MTSuY","number":4379,"title":"Require space after Given/When/Then prefixes","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":175630288,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzU2MzAyODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/alpha%201","name":"alpha 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v5.1","description":"New feature release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

Often all keywords in a resource files have some common tags, and it would be convenient to be able to list them only once. We can support that by adding new `Keyword Tags` setting that can be used in the Settings section. Although the primary use case would we with keywords in resource files, the new setting should work also in test case and suite initialization files. When used in the latter, it should not recurse to lower levels suites or to resource files in the same directory.\r\n\r\nWith tests it's possible to use `Force Tags` and `Default Tags` setting, but there's a proposal to rename the former to `Test Tags` and removing the latter altogether (#4365). That proposal is related to this issue in two ways:\r\n\r\n- If we add `Keyword Tags`, it would be a _lot_ better if the test related setting was `Test Tags` and not `Force Tags`.\r\n- Regardless do we remove `Default Tags` or not, I don't think keyword tags would need that kind of a separate setting.

Tests that run with RF 5.1 or newer should thus use `AS` instead of that.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4371/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4371/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4368","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4368/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4368/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4368/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4368","id":1273320448,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85L5VQA","number":4368,"title":"New `Test Tags` setting as an alias for `Force Tags`","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":121827221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjE4MjcyMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/deprecation","name":"deprecation","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":175630288,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxNzU2MzAyODg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/alpha%201","name":"alpha 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v5.1","description":"New feature release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

All variables can be overridden with locally created variables. For example, in the \"Variable section\" test below `${42}` is overridden but `${TRUE}` is not and in the \"Local variables\" test both are overridden.\r\n\r\n```\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${42}            Overridden\r\n${TRUE}          Not overridden\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nVariable section\r\n    Log to console    ${42}\r\n    Log to console    ${TRUE}\r\n\r\nLocal variables\r\n    ${42} =      Set variable    Overridden again\r\n    ${TRUE} =    Set variable    Overridden this time\r\n    Log to console    ${42}\r\n    Log to console    ${TRUE}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason that `${42}` can be overridden in the Variables section is that it doesn't actually exist initially. The value is created dynamically when the variable is used if a variable with that name doesn't exist. In the example above such a variable is created and it is used instead. Built-in variables that are initialized before execution starts cannot currently be overridden except when creating local variables.\r\n\r\nNot being able to override built-in variables, especially variables like in the above example, could be considered a good idea, but it causes problems when we add new built-in variables. For example, newly added `&{OPTIONS}` (#4229) overrides variables with the same name (incl. `${options}`) as explained in #4274. I believe the best way to avoid these problems is that we make it possible to override all built-in variables.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4279/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4279/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4275","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4275/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4275/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4275/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4275","id":1169079912,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Frr5o","number":4275,"title":"Libdoc does not support specifying argument types using new `arg: X | Y` syntax","user":{"login":"DetachHead","id":57028336,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjU3MDI4MzM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/57028336?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead","html_url":"https://github.com/DetachHead","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/DetachHead/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":110430429,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA0Mjk=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/task","name":"task","color":"ededed","default":false,"description":"Generic task not listed in release notes"},{"id":230194665,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzAxOTQ2NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/rc%202","name":"rc 2","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release concentrating on adding new syntax to Robot Framework language: `TRY/EXCEPT` (#3075), `WHILE` (#4084), inline `IF` (#4093), `RETURN` (#4078) as well as `BREAK` and `CONTINUE` (#4079).

It always rounds half values up (e.g. 0.5 -> 1, 1.5 -> 2) same way as `round` on Python 2 does. On Python 3 `round` uses \"bankers rounding\" algorithm and rounds every second half value down and every second up (e.g. 0.5 -> 0, 1.5 -> 2). There was some merit in using the more familiar rounding algorithm used with Python 2, but the approach used by Python 3 is generally considered better. Using the current Python standard is probably better for us and the built-in `round` is certainly faster.\r\n\r\nAnother reason to use `roundup` was that it preserved the original input type when it didn't remove precision. For example, `roundup(110, -2)` yields `100`, not `100.0`, like `round` with Python 2 does. Python 3 `round` preserves the input type the same way as `roundup` so this isn't a valid reason anymore.\r\n\r\nThis is mostly an internal change, but can naturally affect users if they use keywords doing rounding. For example, `Should Be Equal As Numbers` supports precision that's used for rounding input values before comparison and that is affected. For example, after this change\r\n\r\n```\r\nShould Be Equal As Numbers    135    145    precision=-1\r\n```\r\n\r\nsucceeds because both values are rounded to 140. That's somewhat unfortunate, but I still believe using the same rounding approach Python does is a good idea.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4267/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4267/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4266","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4266/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4266/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4266/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4266","id":1165197020,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Fc37c","number":4266,"title":"Remove deprecated `robot.variables.is_var` and similar functions","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430514,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA1MTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20low","name":"priority: low","color":"41ae76","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":229188865,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMjkxODg4NjU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/rc%201","name":"rc 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/52","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/52/labels","id":5081658,"node_id":"MDk6TWlsZXN0b25lNTA4MTY1OA==","number":52,"title":"v5.0","description":"New major release concentrating on adding new syntax to Robot Framework language: `TRY/EXCEPT` (#3075), `WHILE` (#4084), inline `IF` (#4093), `RETURN` (#4078) as well as `BREAK` and `CONTINUE` (#4079).

Now that we validate options passed to `robot.run/rebot` (#4212), `pythonpath` not being accepted by `RobotSettings` causes problems with Pabot (https://github.com/mkorpela/pabot/issues/450). This problem can be avoided by handling `pythonpath` as other normal options. Instead of processing it already in `ArgumentParser` it should be passed to `RobotSettings` and then later read from there.\r\n\r\nAs part of this change, `auto_pythonpath` argument accepted by `ArgumentParser` needs to be deprecated. `ArgumentParser` resides under `robot.utils` and is thus considered to be part of the public API and removing an option accepted by it would thus be a backwards incompatible change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4239/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4239/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4235","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4235/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4235/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4235/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4235","id":1139789328,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85D784Q","number":4235,"title":"Update

Bug description\r\n\r\n`robot` is now emitting errors for unrecognized reST directives beginning in v4.1.2, even though the directives are not inside the `robotframework` code block. The errors do not cause the `robot` process to fail, but they do clutter up the console.\r\n\r\nThis issue was introduced by the changes in #4085 .
