Framework should get support for configuration files. Configuration files should be loaded automatically (unless disabled) and allow specifying same settings that can be given from the command line. This would make it possible to, for example, to automatically enable the RPA mode, specify listeners that should always be used, and so on. This would be especially useful with features that require more complex configuration such as custom settings (#4409).\n\nThe main reason Robot currently doesn't support configuration files is that it has its own argument file concept that has many of the same benefits. Argument files aren't loaded automatically, though, and them being a Robot-only solution means that you cannot have all project configuration in one place.\n\nAlthough the basic idea is clear, there are lot of design decisions to be made:\n1. What format? Python has pretty much standardized to [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) as configuration syntax and I rather strongly believe we should use that too. [tomllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tomllib.html) is only available starting from Python 3.11, but we can require people using older Python versions to install a backport if they want to use config files.\n2. Should we support the standard `pyproject.toml` or a custom `robot.toml`? I believe we should support both. Actual settings should also be exactly the same regardless the file, but the top level table structure is naturally different.\n3. Where should we look for configuration files? My understanding is that `pyproject.toml` should be only looked from the current directory, but with our `robot.toml` it would probably make sense to support system wide, user wide, project wide, and custom configuration so that the latter ones have precedence over earlier ones. System wide and user wide configs would be loaded from an OS specific configuration file locations, project wide configuration from the current directory, and custom configs could be given using a command like option like `--config path/to/custom.toml`. There should also be a way to disable loading configuration files automatically.\n4. How should each command line option be supported in a configuration file? It's probably best to return to this when implementation starts. This is an important topic, because making changes later causes backwards compatibility problems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5337/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5300","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5300/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5300/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5300/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5300","id":2764234522,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86kwt8a","number":5300,"title":"Drop Python 3.8 and Python 3.9 support","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972220183,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4PFw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20small","name":"effort: small","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":30,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-04-04T15:35:45Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-12-31T10:45:57Z","updated_at":"2024-12-31T10:45:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":"At the moment the minimum Python version we support is Python 3.8. It has already reached its EOL in October 2024, but it is still pretty widely used. It is also the default Python in Ubuntu 20.04 LTS that is supported until April 2025. Python 3.9 will reach its EOL in October 2025. I'm not aware of it being used by any Linux LTS release, so supporting it much longer than that doesn't have too much benefits.\r\n\r\nWe don't currently have concrete plans for RF 8.0 development, but it being released in late 2025 or early 2026 ought to be a good estimate. We can thus can safely drop both Python 3.8 and Python 3.9 support in that release.\r\n\r\nThe main benefit of having Python 3.10 as the minimum version is naturally the possibility to take advantage of new features it contains.

With libraries and resource file we pass the model objects representing them to these methods, but we don't currently have such model objects representing variable files. In RF 7.1 the `variables_import` method thus only gets a dictionary with same information as the matching listener version 2 method.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to heavily refactor variable related code and proper model objects will certainly be implemented as part of that. Once such objects are available, the `variables_import` method should be updated to get these objects instead of the current dictionary. The change will be backwards incompatible, but the method getting a model object that contains more information that the current dictionary and that also can be modified is worth that.\r\n\r\nThe initial plan was to not add `variables_import` until suitable model objects are available. That would have meant that there's still one method that the listener v3 API doesn't have at all, and it was considered better to add the method and enhance it later. Even the initial method allows getting notifications about variable file imports when using the more powerful listener v3 API.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4987","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4987/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4987/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4987/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4987","id":2050371400,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ856Ni9I","number":4987,"title":"Do not continue after failures inside TRY blocks in teardowns","user":{"login":"tminakov","id":7096186,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjcwOTYxODY=","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/7096186?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tminakov","html_url":"https://github.com/tminakov","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tminakov/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tminakov/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tminakov/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tminakov/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tminakov/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tminakov/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tminakov/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tminakov/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tminakov/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":30,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-04-04T15:35:45Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2023-12-20T11:31:49Z","updated_at":"2023-12-20T16:10:15Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","type":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":"When a keyword is ran within a teardown (case or suite) all operations inside a TRY block are executed even if there is an exception.\r\n\r\nConsidering this sample keyword:\r\n```\r\nMy Keyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${condition}\r\n\r\n    TRY\r\n        IF    $condition     Fail    failing text\r\n        Do Operation\r\n    EXCEPT      AS    ${exception}\r\n        Fail      ${exception}\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it's called within a normal context (case) and the condition is met, `Do Operation` will not be executed;

This is done to avoid huge messages messing up logs and reports, but the problem is that some valuable information may be lost. Another issue is that even the resulting messages are somewhat long and take lot of space.\r\n\r\nThe above is an old problem, but the situation is getting worse in RF 7.0 due failure messages being shown not only with tests,but also with each keyword and control structure. Earlier keywords and control structures in the result model didn't have a message at all, but it was added as part of the result model cleanup (#4883). The motivation was this:\r\n- We are adding JSON representation to the result model (#4847) and want the model to be as stable and future-proof as possible.\r\n- We likely want to in the future allow running individual keywords outside Robot core. At that point we want the result model to have a message, not only status as earlier.\r\n- In some special cases (at least with `--flatten-keywords` and `--remove-keywords`) we want to add some extra notes to result objects. Earlier we used documentation for that, but it was odd because control structures such as FOR loops cannot otherwise have a documentation. Using the message for this purpose works much better.\r\n\r\nNow that also keywords and control structures also have a message, the same message can be shown on multiple levels in the log file. That's rather annoying in general, but gets especially irritating if the message is long. To mitigate this issue, and to fix the old issue with long messages, I propose we do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Show only the beginning of long failure messages in log and report by default. I believe we should show so much that typical messages are shown fully, but considerably less than 40 lines that is the current maximum. We could possibly also show more with tests than with keywords and control structures.\r\n2. Have some way to show the full message. Probably a simple \"Show more.\" button/link would be fine.\r\n3. Stop cutting long messages otherwise. This can increase output file sizes, but I doubt the difference is too big.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4931/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914","id":1963840069,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ851DdJF","number":4914,"title":"Enhance token types used by parsing model","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":30,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-04-04T15:35:45Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-10-26T15:34:56Z","updated_at":"2023-10-26T15:34:57Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":"On the lowest level the parsing model consists of tokens having different types. For most parts types are fine, but we have identified few issues with them. We should go them through and do at least the following:\r\n\r\n1. When assigning variables, we sometimes use the type `VARIABLE` and sometimes `ASSIGN`. Issue  #4708 proposed changing the type used with FOR and EXCEPT AS variables from `VARIABLE` to `ASSIGN` to be consistent with variables created from keyword return values. This change was already done during the RF 7.0 development, but it was reverted because it turned out we still used `VARIABLE` with variables created in the Variables section and with the new VAR syntax and i wasn't possible to change also these types in RF 7.0. We need to check all places where variables are created and see can we use a common type in all cases and what that type would be.\r\n\r\n2. We currently use the type `ARGUMENT` with too many different tokens. For example, we use it with IF and WHILE conditions and with variable values in the Variables section and with the VAR syntax. This means that if we wanted to support conditional variable assignment like `VAR    ${x}    IF    $cond    y    ELSE    z` both `$cont` and `y` would have the `ARGUMENT` type. This in turn would make it unnecessarily hard to find the condition and value tokens. It's not certain is this kind of conditional variable assignment a good idea in general, but we should nevertheless change the token types so that implementation is possible. We could, for example, introduce a new `CONDITION` type to be used with all conditions.\r\n\r\n3. `RETURN` should be changed to mean the RETURN statement, not [Return] setting.\r\n\r\n4. There are some deprecated and unused token types we can remove. This includes `WITH_NAME`, `FORCE_TAGS`, `FATAL_ERROR`, `FATAL_INVALID_HEADER` and `RETURN_SETTING`.\r\n\r\n5. We should in general go through the token types and see do they make sense. The idea is to do a proper cleanup once and then try to keep the types stable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858","id":1885309238,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85wX4k2","number":4858,"title":"Remove support for singular section headers","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972220183,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4PFw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20small","name":"effort: small","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":30,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-04-04T15:35:45Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-09-07T07:47:27Z","updated_at":"2023-09-07T07:47:27Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Singular section headers were deprecated in RF 6.0 (#4431) and started to emit actual deprecation warnings in RF 7.0 (#4432).

6.1 made it possible to configure what to do if lengths of lists iterated using `FOR IN ZIP` are different (#4682). The old default behavior to silently ignore items in longer lists (i.e. `SHORTEST` mode) was preserved, but the plan is to deprecate it in RF 7.0 (#4685). In RF 8 we can then change the default so that lengths must match (i.e. `STRICT` mode). The main motivation is avoiding false positives. See #4682 for mode details.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4686/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4686/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674","id":1613542507,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85gLLRr","number":4674,"title":"Support variables in format `$var` in addition to `${var}`","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430421,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA0MjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20critical","name":"priority: critical","color":"00441b","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972225384,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4jaA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20large","name":"effort: large","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":30,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-04-04T15:35:45Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":24,"created_at":"2023-03-07T14:07:35Z","updated_at":"2024-11-27T14:14:55Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":"Curly braces required by Robot's variable syntax can be considered somewhat distracting and even ugly. Depending on the keyboard layout, writing them can also require annoying finger acrobatics. It would thus be convenient if it would be possible to use `$var` instead of `${var}` and also `@list`, `&dict` and `%env` instead of `@{list}`, `&{dict}` and `%{env}`. For example, all these could be supported:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n$VARIABLE        value\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Log    $VARIABLE\r\n    $var =    Keyword\r\n    FOR    $item    IN    @stuff\r\n        Log    $item\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn all the above cases the `$var` syntax is used on its own and that would work fine. This syntax wouldn't work too well when embedded to a string, though. For example, if you have variables `$name` and `$named`, string `Hello, $name!` could be parsed like `Hello, ${name}!`, but `abc$named` could be either `abc${name}d` or `abc${named}`. We could require using the `${var}` syntax in cases where `$var` is ambiguous, that's how [shell scripts](https://learn-bash.org/variables.html) work, but I believe it's better to require it always when variables are embedded. That makes the syntax more consistent and this approach is also considerably easier to implement. We can, however, look at this again later if the `$var` syntax is universally considered better and using it always (when possible) is considered important.\r\n\r\nSupporting the `$var` syntax would be a backwards incompatible change, but if we support it only when variables are used on their own, it shouldn't be that bad. It would mean that all arguments starting with `$`, `@`, `&` and `%` would need to be escaped like `\\$not_var`. We already require this with `#` (which otherwise starts a comment) so there's precedence for such syntax. Nevertheless, this would break lot of tests/tasks and the change can be made only in a major version. It would also be a good idea to deprecate using arguments starting with these characters already earlier. If this enhancement is considered important, it could be added in RF 7.0 and deprecation added in RF 6.2 or possibly already in RF 6.1.\r\n\r\nAlthough the basic syntax would be simple, there are some design decision to be made:\r\n\r\n1. Should we limit variable base name to only alpha numeric characters and underscore? In other words, should something like `$! als lkjas` be considered a variable with base name `! als lkjat` or should the whole thing be considered a literal string? Being more strict with the variable name would mean there's less need for escaping, but then these variables would work inconsistently compared to \"normal\" variables. It would also mean that some built-in variables like `${/}` couldn't be used like `$/`. I got a feeling that it's better if we don't limit the name. \r\n2. Should this syntax support item access like `$list[0]` and `$dict[key][nested]`? I believe it should.\r\n3. Should this syntax support \"extended variable syntax\" like `$var.upper()` and `$SPACE * 10`? I don't have too strong opinion on this, but I guess it would be better to support it. Needing to use `${var.upper()}` in this case would be a bit strange and inconsistent.\r\n\r\nI'll add this issue tentatively to RF 7.0 scope, but we still need to make a bit more official decision about it. If we decide to include it, then another issue should be submitted about deprecating arguments starting with `$` and other such variable meta characters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":5,"-1":4,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478","id":1385930204,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Sm53c","number":4478,"title":"Simpler

automatic argument conversion (#2890) makes it possible to have a keywords like\r\n```python\r\ndef accept_list(arg: list):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\ndef accept_dict(arg: dict):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nand call them so that argument are Python literals\r\n```\r\nAccept List    ['list', 'items', 'here']\r\nAccept Dict    {'key': 'value', 'another': 'item'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty convenient, but needing to use Python syntax is a bit ugly in general and especially annoying when using embedded arguments that are supposed to enhance readability:\r\n```\r\nSelect animals ['cat', 'dog'] from list\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose we enhance argument conversion so that we support also the following syntax:\r\n```\r\nAccept List    list, items, here\r\nAccept Dict    key=value, another=item\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe high level semantics would be as follows:\r\n\r\n- Separator between items is a comma _and_ a space. This allows using commas in values like `first, second,with,commas, third`. Having a comma followed by a space in the value wouldn't be possible.\r\n- We could allow using a semicolon and a space as an alternative separator. In that case we'd use the separator that's encountered first. This would allow usages like `first; second, with, commas followed by spaces; third`.\r\n- With dictionaries the separator between key and value is `=`. This is the syntax we use also when creating `&{dict}` variables.\r\n- Values are considered strings by default. This can be changed by using generics (#4433) and `TypedDict` (#4477).\r\n- Because this would be handled by type convertors, variables would have been resolved already earlier. That means that something like `${1}, ${2}` wouldn't create a list of integers. See the above point for alternatives.\r\n- Also escapes are handled before type conversion. That makes it impossible to use something like `first, second\\,with\\,commas` for escaping commas in values.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement would ease using collections a lot especially if #4433 and #4477 are implemented. If we agree above semantics are fine, implementation would also be pretty easy. I thus add this to RF 5.1 scope even though the release is already late.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472","id":1379984865,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85SQOXh","number":4472,"title":"Allow resource files and libraries to be imported privately in other resource files","user":{"login":"BCGST","id":105816460,"node_id":"U_kgDOBk6hjA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105816460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST","html_url":"https://github.com/BCGST","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972226383,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4nTw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20extra%20large","name":"effort: extra large","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":30,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-04-04T15:35:45Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":15,"created_at":"2022-09-20T20:55:41Z","updated_at":"2024-09-10T10:47:33Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","type":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":"It could be beneficial if users could import resource files and libraries in a \"private\" way.

the other library and cause the opposing library crash the test when they reach the unexpected keyword.\r\n\r\nIn more biased terms, private importation of libraries and resources feels like a much

currently have three settings for controlling tags tests get:\r\n\r\n- `Force Tags` in the Settings section for specifying tags tests will unconditionally get.\r\n- `Default Tags` in the Settings sections for specifying tags tests get, in addition to the forced tags, unless tests themselves have tags.\r\n- `[Tags]` with each tests to specify tags they get in addition to the forced tags. These also override the default tags.\r\n\r\nThis is rather complicated and my understanding is that all three settings are rarely used. I propose we simplify this so that in the future we'd only have two settings:\r\n\r\n- `Test Tags` in the Settings section to specify tags tests always get. Same as `Force Tags` nowadays.\r\n- `[Tags]` with each test to specify tags tests get in addition to the `Test Tags`.\r\n\r\nThe functional difference compared to the current behavior is that there wouldn't be a possibility to specify tags tests get by default but that they could override when needed. For example, something like this wouldn't be possible anymore:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nForce Tags      all have\r\nDefault Tags    most have\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nT1\r\n    No Operation\r\nT2\r\n    [Tags]    only one has\r\n    No Operation\r\nT3\r\n    No Operation\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of using `Default Tags` that some tests override, all tests that actually need these tags must list them explicitly. The change wouldn't be overly big and I actually like this better:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nTest Tags      all have\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nT1\r\n    [Tags]    most have\r\n    No Operation\r\nT2\r\n    [Tags]    only one has\r\n    No Operation\r\nT3\r\n    [Tags]    most have\r\n    No Operation\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change is obviously backwards incompatible and cannot be done without a deprecation period. I propose we do it like this:\r\n- In RF 5.1 add `Test Tags` that basically acts as an alias for `Force Tags`. Also document that `Test Tags` and `[Tags]` are the way forward.\r\n- In RF 6.0 deprecate `Force Tags` and `Default Tags`.\r\n- In RF 7.0 remove `Force Tags` and `Default Tags`.\r\n\r\nThis is currently only a proposal and comments are welcome!

For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing('example')\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords. It is possible to use `BuiltIn.run_keyword` to execute other keywords so that they are shown as child keywords and #4237 discusses better APIs for that usage.\r\n\r\nA problem with using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` is that keywords executed with it must be available as normal keywords either in the library running other keywords or in some other imported library. That's ok if keywords are usable on their own, but it is possible that child keywords cannot be used like that. This problem can be avoided by making it possible to run any callable as the [final proposal](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237#issuecomment-1058077142) in #4237 suggests. There could, however, be even better solutions for the underlying need.\r\n\r\nA solution I have been thinking is is using a context manager that would create a keyword in log (and in output.xml). We probably could use our existing `robot.result.Keyword` for that purpose. The usage could be something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    with Keyword('Do first thing', args=['example'], doc='Example'):\r\n        do_first_thing()\r\n    with Keyword('Do second thing'):\r\n        print('No need to call a method, implementation can be directly inside the context manager!')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the main benefits of this approach compared to `BuitlIn.run_keyword` would be:\r\n1. No need to expose child keywords as real keywords.\r\n2. No need to even make each child keyword a callable. Implementation could be directly inside the context manager.\r\n3. It would be possible to add documentation, tags, etc. to be shown in the log file.\r\n\r\nPoints 1. and 3. would be possible also with `execute_keyword` proposed in #4237. Executing other keywords has also other use cases than logging child keywords, so #4237 is likely needed anyway. It's not certain is 2. alone worth enough to implement this feature. Possibly using a context manager could result with cleaner code, though.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4252/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237","id":1140704583,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85D_cVH","number":4237,"title":"Better API for library keywords to execute other keywords","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972225384,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4jaA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20large","name":"effort: large","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":30,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-04-04T15:35:45Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":10,"created_at":"2022-02-16T23:50:50Z","updated_at":"2023-08-25T11:29:11Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":"It is a relatively common need for library keywords to be able to run other keywords. One good example is SeleniumLibrary, that makes it possible to register a keyword that will be executed if any of its own keywords fails. Sometimes, especially when doing task automation, it is also beneficial to log actions done by the keyword in the log file separately. For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing()\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords, but there are sometimes needs to show `do_first_thing` and `do_second_thing` as child keywords.\r\n\r\nNowadays keywords can execute other keywords by using `BuiltIn.run_keyword`. It works but has several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Arguments are resolved twice. This  means replacing variables and handling syntax like `\\n`. For example, if we have a keyword like\r\n    ```python\r\n    def example(arg):\r\n        BuiltIn().run_keyword('Log To Console', arg)\r\n    ```\r\n    and call it like\r\n    ```\r\n    Example    c:\\\\temp\r\n    ```\r\n    the actually logged string has a tab character. The reason is that `\\\\t` is first resolved to string `\\t` which is then on the second round resolved to a tab.\r\n\r\n    Double resolving can be avoided be registering the keyword to be a \"run keyword variant\", but that API isn't really public and it's also pretty bad in general. We have #2190 about enhancing it and making it public, but it would probably be better to avoid this double resolving altogether.\r\n\r\n2. Related to above, the keyword using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` cannot safely call it without escaping strings. For example, something like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Log To Console', 'c:\\\\temp')` won't work correctly and the argument should be `c:\\\\\\\\temp` instead.\r\n\r\n3. `BuiltIn.run_keyword` only accepts positional arguments. For example, if we had a keyword implemented like\r\n    ```pyhton\r\n    def example(upper=False):\r\n        ...\r\n    ```\r\n    we couldn't call it like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Example', upper=True)` but instead needed to use `BuiltIn.run_keywod('Example', 'upper=True')`.\r\n\r\nThe above examples ought to make it clear that a better API is needed. I have some ideas how to API could look and will write separate comments about that a bit later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170","id":1080815625,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Aa_AJ","number":4170,"title":"Tests

It would allow using keywords in places where currently you'd normally just have plain strings (or variables). Example usages are listed below and possible syntax alternatives discussed in separate comments.\r\n\r\n1. Arguments to other keywords. At the moment you need to this in two steps:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   ${result} =    Keyword    argument\r\n   Another Keyword    ${result}\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n   In Python and other \"real\" programming languages you use something like `another_keyword(keyword('argument'))`, but in Robot's syntax\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   Another Keyword    Keyword    argument\r\n   ```\r\n   is parsed as `Another Keyword` getting two arguments. This cannot be changed so new syntax is needed.\r\n\r\n2. Condition to the forthcoming `IF/ELSE` syntax (#3074). Currently (well, in the future once IF/ELSE is supported), you need to use:\r\n   ```\r\n   ${status} =    Keyword\r\n   IF    ${status}\r\n       Another Keyword\r\n   END\r\n   ```\r\n   and\r\n   ```\r\n   IF    Keyword\r\n       Another Keyword\r\n   END\r\n   ```\r\n   would be parsed as `Keyword` being the expression to evaluate.\r\n\r\n3. Similarly existing FOR loops would benefit from this.\r\n\r\n4. Inline keyword call syntax would also allow adding support to create variables in the `Variables` section based on keyword return values. Currently that's not possible at all, and creating suite level variables dynamically requires using Suite Setup. Being able to do something like this is a pretty common request:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   *** Variables ***\r\n   ${EXAMPLE} =         Keyword    argument\r\n   ```\r\n\r\nThe hardest thing related to this issue is coming up with a good syntax.

(at least, when they can be resolved in the resource-file scope as when we have been explicitly imported the corresponding library)\r\n\r\nP.S.: I know that it is intended that keywords can be resolved at runtime to allow dynamically decide the implementation (I do not remember where I read about that behaviour though). However, this seems to hamper Robot framework keywords reusability, forcing us to work around by prefixing keywords, renaming them (globally unique...!), or implementing these keywords in a .py file (to be imported via Library). Please, you can also consult [this resource example](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#example-resource-file) in the official user guide for additional evidences on how misleading is the current non-local scope resolution.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2581/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2581/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2377","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2377/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2377/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2377/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2377","id":156937107,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWUxNTY5MzcxMDc=","number":2377,"title":"Can't

with some values in it in the first test, then is updated for the second tests (I can verify this by open the file directly), but the variable is not being re-imported / updated.\n\nSteps to reproduce it\n1.-  Create a variable file as x.py with some variables and values\n      example\n       ('fields_to_validate', {'session id': 'YjI2ZTVlYmItYTllZC00N2Q2LWI4NjMtMGZlN2M5NTYxNzAy', 'IP address':

variables and values\n      Import Variables      ${RES_eCAPS_WECAN}/x.py\n\n3.-  Make changes in the values of the variables and save the file\n\n4.- Import the variable file again and check its variables and values\n     I expect the 'import variables' keyword should import file even if was already imported, but this seems not be the case, because the variables keep the values gotten in the first Import (Step 2).\n\nany suggestion?\n\nhere you go more details.\n\nin the following example may help to understand what is going on.\nI first read the file using OperatingSystem.Get File  and its content is displayed.\nright after that I use BuiltIn.Import Variables to import the variables from the same file, and clearly the content is different.\n\nany idea? shouldn't Import Variable

Framework data typically uses the whitespace-separated format that looks like this:\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Keyword    arg1    arg2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, we support also the pipe-separated format like:\r\n```robotframework\r\n| *** Test Cases *** |\r\n| Example |\r\n| | Keyword | arg1 | arg2 |\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of these formats have been supported equally long, since RF 2.1.1 (#375), and they can also be mixed withing a single file because the format is determined based on does a line start with a `|` or not. In practice the latter syntax is very rarely used and I don't even remember when I have seen it used anywhere except in our tests that validate that the syntax works.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to remove the support for the pipe-separated format in order to make the syntax simpler. The main motivation is making it easier to implement new parsers for Robot Framework. It would help making external parsers, for example, for syntax highlighting purposes and it would also make it a lot easier to create a faster parser for Robot itself using C, Rust or Go. The motivation behind #5198 is exactly the same and that issue explains this situation in more detail.\r\n\r\nAlthough this syntax is rarely used, I'm certain it's used _somewhere_ and removing the syntax is obviously backwards incompatible. We thus need to deprecate it first.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5199/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1}]}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/76","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/76","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/76/labels","id":11927078,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Atf4m","number":76,"title":"v7.3","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":2,"closed_issues":24,"state":"open","created_at":"2024-11-20T14:02:28Z","updated_at":"2025-04-15T20:02:28Z","due_on":"2025-04-24T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null,"issues":{"total_count":26,"incomplete_results":false,"items":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5403","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5403/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5403/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5403/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5403","id":2997473886,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86yqdJe","number":5403,"title":"Confusing

with embedded arguments utilizing custom regexps can be used with variables, but only if the variable is used on its own.

It obviously doesn't match `${HI}` either, but the custom regexp handling code automatically handles variables used on their own. That logic has a bug that it doesn't work with the inline evaluation syntax (#5394) and the root cause for that bug is the same that causes this issue.\n\nThe inline evaluation issue (#5394) can be fixed like this:\n\n- Replace variables in the calling keyword with a placeholder before matching the regexp.\n- Keep a mapping between placeholders and original variables.\n- Append the custom regexp with a pattern matching the placeholder.\n- Replace placeholders with original variables after the regexp match.\n\nUnfortunately the above doesn't fix this issue, because the extra content in addition to the single variable means that pattern appended in the second last step doesn't match the whole value. Because I don't see any simple ways to fix this, and because nobody has reported this issue earlier, I believe it is enough to document this limitation.

It obviously doesn't match the normal variable `${HI}` either, but the code handling custom regexps appends a pattern `r'|\\$\\{[^\\}]+\\}'` to the custom regexp and that matches normal variables. It doesn't match the inline evaluation syntax because the match ends for the first closing `}`. The right behavior would be ending the match when there's a balanced number of opening `{`s and closing `}`s, but I doubt regexp can do that.\n\nI noticed this issue when investigating another embedded arguments related issues (#5330). That issue can be fixed by replacing variables with a placeholder before matching the keyword and replacing placeholders with original variables after the match. Incidentally that fix helps fixing also this issue. The only additional thing to do is changing the custom regexp handling code so the current pattern that tries to match variables is changed to a pattern that matches the used placeholders.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5394/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5393","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5393/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5393/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5393/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5393","id":2968614286,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86w8XWO","number":5393,"title":"Cannot

should take automatic code formatting into use. I don't personally need it that much, but it would certainly make it easier for contributors to format their code and that saves my time in reviewing PRs.\n\nI've experimented with Black already years ago, but back then it did some changes that I really disliked and that caused huge amount of noise in history. The situation is nowadays better in that regard, and the amount of unnecessary (in my opinion) and annoying (again, my opinion) changes is pretty small. The Ruff formatter is also so fast that formatting is instantaneous even with our relatively big project. Overall, auto-formatting benefits are nowadays bigger than problems even in my opinion.\n\nAdding auto-formatting to an existing projects basically has two parts:\n- Format the code, adapt it if needed, and commit it.\n- Automate formatting and/or linting so that it happens on CI and with PRs.\n\nThis issue concentrates fully on the first part. My plan is basically this:\n- Create a simple `ruff.toml` and commit it to the project root.\n- Run `ruff format`.\n- Go through the changes and adapt formatting where needed. This is quite a big task, but needs to be done only once.\n- Commit formatting changes as a single commit.\n- Create [--ignore-revs-file](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt) with the above commit and [configure GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-and-understanding-files#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view) to use it.\n- Instruct in contribution guidelines that contributors should run `ruff format` before creating a PR.\n\nFurther automation can then be done later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5387/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5387/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5386","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5386/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5386/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5386/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5386","id":2947855542,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86vtLS2","number":5386,"title":"Dialogs:

are planning to enhance the look and feel of the Dialogs library (#5334) and enhancement is adding custom application and taskbar icons. We'll naturally use the Robot Framework logo and to be able to use with with Dialogs, we need to bundle it with the distribution somehow. Instead of hiding it somewhere, we could make it available in a stable place to make it available also for external tools such as custom installers.\n\nMy proposal is that we add a single PNG image (`logo.png`) with size 256x256 directly inside the `robot` root package. The reason for this proposal is:\n- PNG is a pretty universally accepted icon format.\n- 256x256 is the biggest icon size used on Windows and I doubt other OSes use bigger ones either. Apps typically can scale images and when scaling down, results are pretty good.\n- Having icons for each used size would give better results, but at least with Dialogs the amount of OSes and windows managers that we support is so big that trying to handle them all is too much work. Having a load of icons bundled with Robot doesn't sound like a good idea for maintenance point of view and it would also increase the distribution size considerably.\n- We could consider a separate `robot/assets` folder for icons and other such assets, but I believe having just one icon should be enough and having that prominently in the root sounds good to me. It also make accessing the icon easier.\n\nI believe just having the icon under the `robot` package is enough and we don't need any dedicated API to access it. The reason is that accessing this kind of package data using [importlib.resources](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.html) is very easy:\n```python\nfrom importlib.resources import files, read_binary\n\n# Get a Path-like object\npath = files('robot').joinpath('logo.png')\n\n# Read data directly\ndata = read_binary('robot', 'logo.png')\n```\nAlthough no API is needed, this needs

#5376 proposes enhancing the Process library so that if Robot's timeout occurs when a process is waited to end, the process is killed instead of leaving it running on the background. That turned out to be surprisingly simple. Because other libraries may have similar needs, we should document how to do that in the User Guide. In addition to that, we should make sure that the related APIs are good.\n\nWhen Robot's timeout occurs, `robot.errors.TimeoutError` is raised in the library code. It can basically occur at any point similarly as the standard `KeyboardInterrupt` or `SystemExit`. The simplest way to do cleanup activities if any exception occurs is using `try/finally`. It is really simple and straightforward, and it also has a benefit that the exception is automatically re-raised:\n\n```python\ndef keyword():\n    try:\n        do_something()\n    finally:\n        do_cleanup()\n```\n\nIn some cases there may be a need to catch Robot's `TimeoutError` explicitly. That's easy as well, but then the exception should be re-raised explicitly:\n\n```python\nfrom robot.errors import TimeoutError\n\ndef keyword():\n    try:\n        do_something()\n    except TimeoutError:\n        do_cleanup()\n        raise\n```\n\nA problem with the above is that Python also has its own [TimeoutError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TimeoutError). This is problematic because `TimeoutError` shadows the standard exception and also because you don't know which exception `except TimeoutError:` refers to when you see just that line. Now that we are planning to make our `TimeoutError` part of the public API, I believe we should rename it to avoid confusion. I think `TimeoutExceeded` would be fine, it's different to `subprocess.TimeoutExpired`, but I'm open for other ideas as well. To avoid backwards compatibility problems, we should preserve the old name as an alias at least until RF 9.\n\nIf you wonder why we added `TimeoutError` in the first place when Python also has `TimeoutError`, the reason is that ours was there first. It existed already in RF 2.0, the first open source version, in 2008, but Python got its `TimeoutError` only in Python 3.3 in 2012.

#5345 reported that Robot's timeouts weren't able to stop `Run Process` or `Wait For Process` keywords. That was fixed so that these keywords can be stopped, but processes that keywords were waiting for were left running. Leaving process on background especially is likely not a good idea, especially because they often have hung in this case. This issue proposes killing the processes instead.\n\nKilling processes if Robot's timeout occur requires handling the timeout in the library code. That is actually surprisingly easy by catching `robot.errors.TimeoutError` and re-raising it once the process has been killed. There could be other libraries that want to do such cleanup as well, and documenting how to do that in the User Guide is probably a good idea. I'll submit a separate issue about that.\n\nNotice that killing process as proposed above doesn't fully prevent processes to be left running. That can still happen if you use `Start Process` and Robot's timeout occurs before `Wait For Process` is called. We could enhance the library by adding some kind of auto-closing functionality to it, but I don't consider that too high priority because the library already has `Terminate All Processes` that can be used in test or suite teardown. Such an enhancement should anyway get its own issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5376/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5368","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5368/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5368/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5368/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5368","id":2920313961,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86uEHRp","number":5368,"title":"Library

using the `[Teardown]` setting with a keyword that accepts a list as an embedded argument, the variable is passed as a string rather than as a list. This behavior causes list-related keywords (such as` Log List`) to fail with a `TypeError`, even though the same keyword works correctly when called directly or using `Run Keyword`.\n\n**Code to Reproduce:**\n\n```robotframework\n*** Settings ***\nLibrary     Collections\n\n*** Variables ***\n@{my_list}      test_value    test_value2\n\n*** Test Cases ***\nTeardown Situation 1    # This works fine\n    Log To Console    \\n    # Keyword to avoid empty test error\n    Keyword With Embbed Arguments \"${my_list}\"\n\nTeardown Situation 2    # This fails\n    Log To Console    \\n    \n    [Teardown]    Keyword With Embbed Arguments \"${my_list}\"\n\nTeardown Situation 3    # This fails\n    Log To Console    \\n\n    [Teardown]    Keyword With Embbed Arguments \"@{my_list}\"\n\nTeardown Situation 4    # This works\n    Log To Console    \\n\n    [Teardown]    Run Keyword    Keyword With Embbed Arguments \"${my_list}\"\n\nTeardown Situation 5    # This works\n    Log To Console    \\n\n    [Teardown]    Run Keyword    Keyword With Embbed Arguments \"@{my_list}\"\n\n*** Keywords ***\nKeyword With Embbed Arguments \"${argument}\"\n    Log To Console    ${argument}\n\n    # Verifying the type of the received variable\n    ${result}=    Evaluate    type(${argument})\n    Log To Console    ${result}\n    \n    # Every list-related keyword generates an error:\n    # TypeError: Expected argument 1 to be a list or list-like, got string instead.\n    Log List    ${argument}\n\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nWhen a list variable (either `${my_list}` or `@{my_list}`) is passed via `[Teardown]` with embedded arguments, it should retain its list type and work seamlessly with list-related keywords.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\nIn the failing cases, the list variable is interpreted as a string, leading to errors in keywords (e.g., `Log List`) that expect a list.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- Workaround: Using `Run Keyword` in the teardown (as shown in Teardown Situations 4 and 5) avoids the issue.\n- Environment: Windows 10 Pro 22H2, Python 3.10.11, Robot-Framework

noticed in scenarios where the [test case timeout](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#timeouts) is employed that Windows hosts are not able to continue past the Process related keywords. It looks like this was alluded to in [2056#issuecomment-118502807](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/2056#issuecomment-118502807).\n\n#2061 touches upon the implications of timeouts on resources and [Terminate Process](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/Process.html#Terminate%20Process) does note some behavioral distinctions for Windows but neither address if the Process keywords should be stopped, as seen on a Linux host, or can continue to block as seen on a Windows host.\n\nI'll note that the comment above provides a sensible workaround by leveraging a variable for the process timeouts, just trying to qualify if this behavior is a bug, by design, or notable enough to document.\n\nA reproducible case is outline below noting the behavioral difference in the `output.xml` snippets.\n\n```\n*** Settings ***\nLibrary  OperatingSystem\nLibrary  Process\n\n*** Variables ***\n${EXT} =  ${{(platform.system() == \"Windows\" and

defining custom language prefixes for BDD steps in the Robot Framework (for example, in a French language module), I observed that adding multiple prefixes with overlapping substrings (e.g., \"Sachant que\" and \"Sachant\") leads to intermittent failures in matching the intended BDD step.\n\n**Steps to Reproduce:**\n\nCreate a custom language (e.g., a French language class) inheriting from Language.\nDefine given_prefixes with overlapping entries such as:\n\n`given_prefixes = ['Étant donné', 'Soit', 'Sachant que', 'Sachant']`\n\nRun tests that rely on detecting BDD step prefixes.\nOccasionally, tests fail with errors indicating that the keyword \"Sachant que\" cannot be found, even though it is defined.\nExpected Behavior:\nThe regex built from the BDD prefixes should consistently match the longer, more specific prefix (\"Sachant que\") instead of prematurely matching the shorter prefix (\"Sachant\").\n\n**Observed Behavior:**\nDue to the unordered nature of Python sets, the bdd_prefixes property (which is constructed using a set) produces a regex with the alternatives in an arbitrary order. This sometimes results in the shorter prefix (\"Sachant\") matching before the longer one (\"Sachant que\"), causing intermittent failures.\n\n**Potential Impact:**\n\nUnpredictable test failures when multiple BDD prefixes with overlapping substrings are used.\nDifficulty in debugging issues due to the non-deterministic nature of the problem.\nSuggested Fix:\nSort the BDD prefixes by descending length before constructing the regular expression. For example:\n\n\n```\n@property\ndef bdd_prefix_regexp(self):\n    if not self._bdd_prefix_regexp:\n        # Sort prefixes by descending length so that the longest ones are matched first\n        prefixes = sorted(self.bdd_prefixes, key=len, reverse=True)\n        pattern = '|'.join(prefix.replace(' ', r'\\s') for prefix in prefixes).lower()\n        self._bdd_prefix_regexp = re.compile(rf'({pattern})\\s', re.IGNORECASE)\n    return self._bdd_prefix_regexp\n\n```\nThis change would ensure that longer, more specific prefixes are matched before their shorter substrings, eliminating the intermittent failure.\n\n**Environment:**\n\nRobot Framework version: 7.1.1\nPython version: 3.11.5\n\n**Additional Notes:**\nThis bug appears to be caused by the unordered nature of sets in Python, which is used in the bdd_prefixes property to combine all prefixes. The issue might not manifest when there are only three prefixes or when there is no overlapping substring scenario.\n\nI hope this detailed report helps in reproducing and resolving the issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5340/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5340/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5334","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5334/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5334/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5334/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5334","id":2838908115,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86pNkzT","number":5334,"title":"Dialogs:

3.1 added automatic argument conversion with library keywords using function annotations (#2890), default values (#2932), and some other means. That has worked very well, and it would be nice if something like that would work also with variables defined in test data. We probably could re-use the underlying argument conversion logic which ought to make it relatively easy to implement this. We also got a similar request related to variables passed from the command line #2946.\r\n\r\nAutomatically converting numbers like `42` and `3.14` to actual integers/floats would be handy, even when we already support them as variables like `${42}` and `${3.14}`. Being able to use datatime objects, bytes, and other types supported by the argument conversion that don't have direct variable alternatives would naturally be even more useful (but also less commonly needed). I would expect this to be most useful with lists and dictionaries and especially with nested list and dicts that cannot easily be constructed in Robot's data.\r\n\r\nMy proposed syntax for this functionality is supporting \"type postfix\" like `:int` in variable names like this:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${COUNT:int}         42\r\n${GOOD IDEA:bool}    Yes    # Converted to Boolean True\r\n${ANIMALS:list}      ['cat', 'dog', 'horse']    # Python syntax\r\n${NESTED:dict}       {'a': 1, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}    # Great with JSON\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax is derived from Python's function annotation syntax and also the same syntax that was decided to be used with command line variables in #2946. Created variable names would naturally omit the type suffix and look like `${COUNT}` and `${GOOD IDEA}`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being available in the variable section, the new syntax should also be available also when creating variable otherwise, including in keyword arguments:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nExample\r\n    [Arguments]    ${count:int}\r\n    ${nested:dict} =    Set Variable    {'a': ${count}, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}\r\n    Set Test Variable    ${DATE:datetime}     2019-08-23 12:03:42\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are some design decision still to be made like should `${X:dict}` create a `DotDict` instance that allows `${X.key}` syntax and how to handle possible backwards incompatibility issues. For most parts the design looks pretty good, though, and I think this would be a valuable addition to Robot Framework. If there's enough interest, we can consider adding this already to RF 3.2 scope.

parsing model supports setting errors for individual tokens, but there are two problems with the current approach:\r\n\r\n1. Errors (typically syntax errors) aren't separated from warnings (typically deprecations). This caused a problem when deprecating singular section headers (#4432) and the code reporting the warning as part of execution needed to know [what errors can occur in different contexts](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/d007855fea4957031cb952c4157fa36dfb3b7228/src/robot/running/builder/transformers.py#L516) to handle the problem. With the planned deprecation of the pipe-separated format (#5203) this is likely even a bigger problem, because there's no single context where pipes can be used.\r\n2. It isn't easy to recognize if the same error/warning occurs multiple times in same file. This requires comparing messages, but because they typically contain some variables parts, they cannot be compared directly. Searching for a certain sub-string is also problematic, because error messages can change.\r\n\r\nMy proposal for solving both of the above problems is adding new `errno` attribute to to the `Token` objects with the following semantics:\r\n1. `errno` is an integer representing an error code.\r\n2. Each error and warning has a different code.\r\n3. Codes have constant names like `ERR_SINGULAR_HEADER_DEPRECATED` stored as attributes of the `Token` class.\r\n4. Errors and warnings have different ranges so that it is easy to separate them. We could, for example, use negative values with warnings and positive with errors. Zero would mean no error/warning.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5210/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5210/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5203","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5203/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5203/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5203/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5203","id":2514325858,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86V3ZFi","number":5203,"title":"Deprecate pipe-separated format","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":121827221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjE4MjcyMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/deprecation","name":"deprecation","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972220183,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4PFw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20small","name":"effort: small","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/79","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/79","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/79/labels","id":12675077,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84AwWgF","number":79,"title":"v7.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":16,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2025-04-04T14:44:01Z","updated_at":"2025-04-16T14:37:52Z","due_on":"2025-06-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":4,"created_at":"2024-09-09T15:51:19Z","updated_at":"2025-04-04T14:45:02Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","type":{"id":122831,"node_id":"IT_kwDOAAjDTM4AAd_P","name":"Feature","description":"A request, idea, or new functionality","color":"blue","created_at":"2024-01-25T09:13:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T08:31:31Z","is_enabled":true},"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":"The pipe-separated format is very little used and for the reasons explained in #5199 we have decided to remove it.

{self.num}')\r\n```\r\nAs I import the library each time with a different argument, I would expect, that a new instance of the library is created that overwrites the current instance. Instead, the very first instance of the library seems to be used as the output of both calls of `Log Params` is 1.\r\n\r\nDid I understand the note in the user guide wrong or is this an unintended

To help with that, various libraries have keywords that avoid logging given values even though their keywords normally do that. For example, SeleniumLibrary has `Input Password` that doesn't log the password and also temporarily disables Robot's logging to avoid the password being logged by the underlying Selenium on DEBUG level. This works fine otherwise, but if tests are run with `--loglevel TRACE`, Robot anyway logs all argument values and the password will be visible. Browser's `Fill Secret` tries to avoid that problem by requiring the value to be passed using a special `$var` syntax so that Robot won't log the actual variable value. Unfortunately that doesn't work if the value is passed to `Fill Secret` via a user keyword and only that keyword uses the `$var` syntax like in the following example:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${PASSWORD}        secret\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Keyword    ${PASSWORD}    # This value is logged on TRACE level\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nKeyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${pwd}\r\n    Fill Secret    selector    $pwd\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to use values that should not be logged, I propose we add new variable syntax `*{var}` to create \"secret variables\". The syntax could be used when creating variables in the Variables section, when creating local variables based on keyword return values, and with `Set Global/Suite/Test/Local Variable` keywords. The syntax would be only used for creating variables, they would be used normally like `${var}`:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n*{PASSWORD}        secret\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Keyword    ${PASSWORD}\r\n    *{local} =    Another keyword\r\n    Keyword    ${local}\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nKeyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${pwd}\r\n    Fill Secret    selector    ${pwd}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTechnically the `*{var}` assignment would create a custom object with this kind of implementation:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Secret:\r\n    def __init__(self, value, name=None):\r\n        self.value = value\r\n        self.name = name\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        return f'<Secret {self.name}>' if self.name else '<Secret>'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese objects would be used when the variable is passed from tests to user keywords and from user keywords to other user keywords. The real value would, however, be passed to library keywords so they would get values normally and wouldn't need to be changed to benefit from this new syntax.\r\n\r\nAlthough this new syntax would work with existing keywords, we should make it possible for library keywords to require arguments to be \"secret\". That's basically what `Fill Secret` does but this new syntax would avoid the problem that the value can be logged on higher level. A convenient way to support this would be type hints:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom robot.api.secrets import Secret\r\n\r\ndef example(secret: Secret):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would work so that Robot would validate that the used value is a `Secret` and fail if it's not. I believe we should pass the real value, not the actual `Secret` object, to the underlying keyword also in this case. That can confuse type checkers but keywords can use [typing.cast](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.cast) if that's a problem. To support normal type conversion, we should also allow parameterizing the type hint like `Secret[int]`.\r\n\r\nKeywords could also return secret values simply by returning `Secret` instances:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom robot.api.secrets import Secret\r\n\r\ndef example():\r\n    return Secret('value')\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537/reactions","total_count":6,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":1,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4409","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4409/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4409/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4409/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4409","id":1306497128,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85N35Bo","number":4409,"title":"Custom test settings a.k.a. test metadata","user":{"login":"tomaspekarovic","id":68331267,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjY4MzMxMjY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/68331267?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaspekarovic","html_url":"https://github.com/tomaspekarovic","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaspekarovic/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaspekarovic/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaspekarovic/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaspekarovic/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaspekarovic/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaspekarovic/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaspekarovic/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaspekarovic/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/tomaspekarovic/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972225384,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4jaA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20large","name":"effort: large","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/79","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/79","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/79/labels","id":12675077,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84AwWgF","number":79,"title":"v7.4","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":16,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2025-04-04T14:44:01Z","updated_at":"2025-04-16T14:37:52Z","due_on":"2025-06-30T07:00:00Z","closed_at":null},"comments":11,"created_at":"2022-07-15T20:55:34Z","updated_at":"2025-04-04T14:45:01Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","type":{"id":122831,"node_id":"IT_kwDOAAjDTM4AAd_P","name":"Feature","description":"A request, idea, or new functionality","color":"blue","created_at":"2024-01-25T09:13:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T08:31:31Z","is_enabled":true},"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"active_lock_reason":null,"body":"It would be great If we have keyword that will be able to set `test metadata` to test report.

methods are often used by libraries and listeners for setting variables. When these methods are used, they log the name and value of the variable that's set. That's typically fine, but not when they are used by listeners when keywords aren't started.\n\nIf they are used in `start/end_keyword`, messages are ignored, because it in general isn't possible to log in those methods. That used to be the case also in `start/end_test`, but that was changed by #5266 in RF 7.2. As the result, a listener like this causes a message to be logged:\n\n```python\nfrom robot.libraries.BuiltIn import BuiltIn\n\ndef start_test(data, result):\n    BuiltIn().set_test_variable('${EXAMPLE}', 'value')\n```\n\nThe logged  message is shown in the log file and it is also in `TestCase.body` in the result model. The message will look like `${EXAMPLE} = value` so it's not very informative without additional context. In the result model it may cause problems with tools that don't expect messages to be present in test body. Because these message mostly add noise and they can cause severe problems, it's better to not log them in the first place. If a listener wants variable values to be shown, they can log such information explicitly with enough context information.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5331/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5331/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5326","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5326/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5326/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5326/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5326","id":2814202946,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86nvVRC","number":5326,"title":"Messages

I think the only way that could happen is when using a listener that logs something in `start_test` or if results are modified programmatically. Crashes are nevertheless always bad, and based on a thread on our Slack someone had encountered this issue, so this requires a pretty high severity.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5326/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5326/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5325","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5325/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5325/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5325/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5325","id":2809354823,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86nc1pH","number":5325,"title":"Elapsed

writing execution times output.xml, we always include the elapsed time and also include the start time if it is set. Typically the start time is available, but it is cleared, for example, when merging results.\n\nThe code parsing execution times from output.xml tries to detect is the format new (RF >= 7.0) or old (RF < 7.0) by looking is the `start` attribute set. In the old format there's `starttime` instead of `start`, but `start` is also missing if the suite didn't have the start time set. In such cases the elapsed time is fully ignored. This is easy to fix by looking at the `elapsed` attribute instead of `start`.\n\nIf elapsed time is not parsed, it's calculated automatically based on child element elapsed times. That is typically the right time, so it's unlikely that anyone is actually affected by this bug.

This is easy to fix by using `parent.body.filter(messages=True)` in that case.\r\n\r\nApparently our code nor nobody else has used `Message.id`, because our tests pass and nobody has reported this. Instead of fixing `Message.id` we could simply remove it, but I believe its good that all body items have

A concrete use case is that `JsonLogger` implemented as part of #3423 needs to know is a parent of a teardown keyword a suite or a test.\r\n\r\nKeywords and control structures already have a `type` attribute that's need also in JSON serialization, but using `kw.parent.type` currently fails if the parent happens to be a test or a suite. A workaround is importing appropriate classes and using something like `isinstance(kw.parent, TestSuite)`, but in many usages using `kw.parent == 'SUITE` is more convenient. Another workaround is implementing also `start_suite`, `start_test` and `start_body_item` and keeping track of the parent type separately. That can be needed in some cases anyway, but in simple usages accessing the `type` attribute is a lot simpler.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5287/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5287/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5286","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5286/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5286/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5286/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5286","id":2717055788,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86h8vss","number":5286,"title":"Add

6.1 (#4676) to recommend using the `$x` syntax, and what you get nowadays is something like this:\r\n> Invalid IF condition: Evaluating expression \"xxx == 'expected'\" failed: NameError: name 'xxx'

recursive execution failing on Python side for `RecursionError` in an unexpected location, which typically breaks output.xml, we have a hard limit of 100 recursive keyword or control structures. The limit was added in RF 2.7 (#551) and it was initially 42, but it was raised to 100 in RF 5.0 (#4191) when we didn't need to anymore think about Jython.\r\n\r\nA recent change to listeners (#5268) allowed listeners to get notifications from actions they initiated which may cause recursion with listeners. For example, this one keeps calling `Log` forever (i.e. until recursion is forcefully stopped):\r\n```python\r\nfrom robot.libraries.BuiltIn import BuiltIn\r\n\r\ndef start_keyword(data, result):\r\n    BuiltIn().run_keyword('Log', 'Recursion!')\r\n```\r\n\r\nInterestingly in this usage the current mechanism to detect recursion doesn't work. As the result, execution using the above listeners fails so that output.xml is corrupted. The reason seems to be that there are more Python stack frames used when listeners are involved and a simple fix would be lowering the current limit of 100 started keywords or control structures to something like 75. I guess that would be fine, but there could be someone who's affected by the change.\r\n\r\nAn alternative fix is coming up with a better way to detect recursion. Instead of having a hard limit of started keywords or control structures, we could look are we close to Python's recursion limit. That was actually mentioned as an option already in #551, but [mentioned in a comment](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/551#issuecomment-47478924), using `len(inspect.stack())` would be really slow. Good news is that I found a more performant way to do that using [sys._getframe](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys._getframe). `sys._getframe` isn't guaranteed to exist on all Python implementations, but it exists at least in PyPy and it's easy to handle it not existing in

a listener runs a keyword using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` or logs a message using `robot.api.logger`, their `start/end_keyword` or `log_message` methods are not called. This is inconsistent, because if listeners modify the data so that they add new keyword calls, their `start/end_keyword` methods are called and, if keywords log something. also `log_message` is called. This also leads to a situation where the result model will have more information that listeners have received. I noticed this when enhancing the result model created during execution so that it contains also log messages (#5260). \r\n\r\nThe reason that listeners don't get notifications from actions they initiate is that it is explicitly prohibited to avoid recursion. Recursion is a valid concern, because if `start_keyword` blindly calls `BuiltIn.run_keyword` or `log_message` blindly calls `logger.info`, they end up being called again until the recursion limit is exceeded. That is, however, a bug in a listener and it should be fixed.

Context\r\n\r\nIssue #5089 proposed making it possible for listeners to remove log messages altogether by setting them to an empty string. It was not implemented for the following reasons:\r\n- It turned out that there are valid reasons to log empty messages and removing them can cause undesired results especially with `Log Many`.\r\n- The enhancement itself wasn't considered important enough.\r\n\r\nOne of the things PR #5084 proposed was adding a new log level above INFO to make it possible to easily remove most of the messages. As I commented the PR, I don't think a new hard-coded level is a good idea, but we could make it possible to add custom levels. That is quite a big task, though, and I started to think that listeners being able to remove messages would provide similar functionality.\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nBased on #5089 and #5084 it is convenient to be able to remove messages. This is my proposal how to do it without problems in #5089:\r\n\r\n- Allow listeners to remove messages altogether by setting them to `None`. In practice these messages simply aren't written to output.xml and thus they won't end up to the log file either.\r\n- For consistency, allow also model modifiers (`--pre-rebot-modifier`) to remove messages the same way. \r\n- Make sure that everything logged normally is converted to strings. For example, `logger.info(None)` should log string `None` instead of the message being ignored.\r\n\r\nThis ought to be a safe change because the last point makes sure normal logging isn't affected. The only risk I see that if one model modifier sets `msg.message` to `None` and then another does something like `if 'xxx' in msg.message`, there's a TypeError. We could prevent this by not supporting this functionality with model modifiers. With them it's possible to remove messages also otherwise with something like `msg.parent.body.remove(msg)`, but `msg.message = None` is simpler and consistent with listeners.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5251/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5251/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5245","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5245/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5245/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5245/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5245","id":2598622280,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86a49RI","number":5245,"title":"`robot.api.parsing`

the moment we explicitly disallow using any kind of regular expression extensions using format `(?...)`, but it would be a good idea to support iniline flags. For more details about regexp extensions and inline flags see the [regular expression syntax](https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html#regular-expression-syntax).\r\n\r\nProbably the only flag that's actually relevant for us is case-insensitivity i.e. `(?i)`, but we can easily accept them all. Why case-insensitivity is important is illustrate by the following example.\r\n\r\nAssume we have the following keyword that allows selecting an animal so that animals are limited to `cat`, `dog` and `cow`.\r\n```python\r\nfrom robot.api.deco import keyword\r\n\r\n\r\n@keyword('Select ${animal:cat|dog|cow}')\r\ndef select(animal):\r\n    print(animal)\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's then have the following tests using this keywod.\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nWorks fine\r\n    Select dog\r\n\r\nWorks but causes deprecation warning\r\n    Select Dog\r\n```\r\nAs the test case names already illustrate, the first one using one of the listed animals exactly works fine. The second test where one of the animals is used with a different case also passes, but there's the following deprecation warning:\r\n> Embedded argument 'animal' got value 'Dog' that does not match custom pattern 'cat|dog|cow'. The argument is still accepted, but this behavior will change in Robot Framework 8.0.\r\n\r\nThe deprecation warning is caused by #4069. It was added because we want to start validating that arguments match also when they are given as variables, and it hadn't occurred to me earlier that there's a similar situation also if there's a case-insensitive match. The reason there's the warning in this particular case is that:\r\n- The initial keyword matching is case-insensitive and thus both `dog` and `Dog` match. This check is done before variables are resolved.\r\n- After variables are resolved, there's a separate check that arguments match custom patterns. In this check `Dog` doesn't match anymore.\r\n\r\nI think custom pattern matching being case-sensitive is fine, but there should be an option to make explicitly make it case-insensitive. A natural syntax with regexps is using inline flags as in the example below, but at the moment that doesn't work.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@keyword('Select ${animal:(?i)cat|dog|cow}')\r\ndef select(animal):\r\n    print(animal)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI believe it's important to do this before RF 8.0 where #4069 is planned to be implemented.
