got an explicit argument converter that accepts any value in RF 6.1 (#4647). At the moment when `Any` is used in an union like `arg: int | Any`, no argument conversion is done. The reason is that `Any` accepts anything without conversion and a union accepts values without conversion if any of its nested types accepts them. This behavior isn't very useful, because it would be simpler to just use `arg: Any` if that would be the desired behavior. Instead we should try conversion to other types, from left to right, and return the value of the first conversion that succeeds. If no other conversion would succeed, at least `Any` conversion would. Because `Any` accepts any value, types after any if used like `arg: int | Any | float` would in practice be ignored.\n\nWe had the same situation with `object` that got an explicit no-op converter in RF 7.4 (#5529). It initially worked like `Any` currently does when used in an union, but the [behavior was changed](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5529#issuecomment-3623587739) just before the final release. The decision back then was not to change any because it would change existing functionality and RF 7.4 was already in the release candidate phase. We could do the change already in RF 7.5, but it is probably better to wait for a major version before making this backwards incompatible change.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5571/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5571/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5481","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5481/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5481/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5481/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5481","id":3307594939,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ87FJeS7","number":5481,"title":"Errors

when using `--flattenkeywords`, all content is written to output files during execution and flattening is done only when outputs are processed. This is different to using the special `robot:flatten` tag (#4584), because with it flattening happens already during the execution. I propose we change `--flattenkeywords` so that also it works already during execution. Some reasons below:\n- Consistency. It's somewhat odd that seemingly similar features work differently.\n- Smaller output files. Flattened content is never written anywhere.\n- Better performance. Not needing to process content that's going to be flattened saves time and memory. This is especially important with JSON, because with it flattening happens only the result model has been built (#5464).\n\nThis change is backwards incompatible, because the original non-flattened content won't be saved at all. Most users probably don't care and those who do can run tests without flattening and then use Rebot to generate flattened logs. Anyway, better to do this change in a major version.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5469/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5469/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5369","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5369/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5369/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5369/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5369","id":2923184070,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86uPD_G","number":5369,"title":"Change

regards to VAR syntax and Set <scope> Variable there are a few behaviors that do not functionally match.\n\nMy observation is that the VAR syntax cannot change an existing variable's scope.\n\nThis is a known RF pattern:\n\n``` robot\n${SOME_FUTURE_SUITE_VARIABLE}     Get Time\nSet Suite Variable    ${SOME_FUTURE_SUITE_VARIABLE}\n```\n\nIn order to so the same thing:\n\n``` robot\n${SOME_FUTURE_SUITE_VARIABLE}     Get Time\nVAR   ${SOME_FUTURE_SUITE_VARIABLE}    ${SOME_FUTURE_SUITE_VARIABLE}     scope=SUITE\n```\n\n> Quoted from Pekka:\n> \n> `VAR    ${X}    scope=suite`\n> \n> not working the same way as\n> \n> `Set Suite Variable    ${X}`\n> \n> is bad design and needing to use\n> \n> `VAR    ${X}    ${X}    scope=suite`\n> \n> This:\n> \n> `VAR    ${X}`\n> \n> creates a variable with an empty string as its value.\n> \n> The change would backwards incompatible.\n> \n> We could deprecate that behavior in RF 7.3 and require using:\n> \n> `VAR    ${X}    ${EMPTY}`\n> \n>  Then later, possibly already in RF 8, we could change the syntax to match `Set Suite Variable`.\n\nHere is some example code:\n\n``` robot\n*** Settings ***\nDocumentation

Framework should get support for configuration files. Configuration files should be loaded automatically (unless disabled) and allow specifying same settings that can be given from the command line. This would make it possible to, for example, to automatically enable the RPA mode, specify listeners that should always be used, and so on. This would be especially useful with features that require more complex configuration such as custom settings (#4409).\n\nThe main reason Robot currently doesn't support configuration files is that it has its own argument file concept that has many of the same benefits. Argument files aren't loaded automatically, though, and them being a Robot-only solution means that you cannot have all project configuration in one place.\n\nAlthough the basic idea is clear, there are lot of design decisions to be made:\n1. What format? Python has pretty much standardized to [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) as configuration syntax and I rather strongly believe we should use that too. [tomllib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tomllib.html) is only available starting from Python 3.11, but we can require people using older Python versions to install a backport if they want to use config files.\n2. Should we support the standard `pyproject.toml` or a custom `robot.toml`? I believe we should support both. Actual settings should also be exactly the same regardless the file, but the top level table structure is naturally different.\n3. Where should we look for configuration files? My understanding is that `pyproject.toml` should be only looked from the current directory, but with our `robot.toml` it would probably make sense to support system wide, user wide, project wide, and custom configuration so that the latter ones have precedence over earlier ones. System wide and user wide configs would be loaded from an OS specific configuration file locations, project wide configuration from the current directory, and custom configs could be given using a command like option like `--config path/to/custom.toml`. There should also be a way to disable loading configuration files automatically.\n4. How should each command line option be supported in a configuration file? It's probably best to return to this when implementation starts. This is an important topic, because making changes later causes backwards compatibility problems.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5337/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5337/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5300","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5300/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5300/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5300/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5300","id":2764234522,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86kwt8a","number":5300,"title":"Drop Python 3.8 and Python 3.9 support","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972220183,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4PFw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20small","name":"effort: small","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":39,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-12-08T22:58:34Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2024-12-31T10:45:57Z","updated_at":"2025-12-02T13:24:14Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","type":{"id":122831,"node_id":"IT_kwDOAAjDTM4AAd_P","name":"Feature","description":"A request, idea, or new functionality","color":"blue","created_at":"2024-01-25T09:13:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T08:31:31Z","is_enabled":true},"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"At the moment the minimum Python version we support is Python 3.8.

With libraries and resource file we pass the model objects representing them to these methods, but we don't currently have such model objects representing variable files. In RF 7.1 the `variables_import` method thus only gets a dictionary with same information as the matching listener version 2 method.\r\n\r\nThe plan is to heavily refactor variable related code and proper model objects will certainly be implemented as part of that. Once such objects are available, the `variables_import` method should be updated to get these objects instead of the current dictionary. The change will be backwards incompatible, but the method getting a model object that contains more information that the current dictionary and that also can be modified is worth that.\r\n\r\nThe initial plan was to not add `variables_import` until suitable model objects are available. That would have meant that there's still one method that the listener v3 API doesn't have at all, and it was considered better to add the method and enhance it later. Even the initial method allows getting notifications about variable file imports when using the more powerful listener v3 API.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5116/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5116/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5088","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5088/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5088/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5088/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5088","id":2202707412,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86DSqXU","number":5088,"title":"Lists

a keyword is ran within a teardown (case or suite) all operations inside a TRY block are executed even if there is an exception.\r\n\r\nConsidering this sample keyword:\r\n```\r\nMy Keyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${condition}\r\n\r\n    TRY\r\n        IF    $condition     Fail    failing text\r\n        Do Operation\r\n    EXCEPT      AS    ${exception}\r\n        Fail      ${exception}\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf it's called within a normal context (case) and the condition is met, `Do Operation` will not be executed; but if it's in a teardown, `Do Operation` is still ran.\r\n\r\nThis behavior is inline with the expectations set with teardowns - that all calls inside them (and inner for called keywords) are executed, in attempt to clean up the environment.\r\n  \r\nStill I'd like to nominate the TRY/EXCEPT blocks for different behavior - when there's an exception in a TRY to halt further calls and fall back to the EXCEPT and FINALLY calls. This will allow the usage of exception handling as normal flow control (like in python), and clear workarounds like the one below.\r\n\r\nThe workaround I'm normally using is to have bogus `RETURN` statements (or huge embedded IF blocks); for instance in the same example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nMy Keyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${condition}\r\n\r\n    IF   $condition     \r\n        Fail    failing text\r\n        RETURN     # just so the next lines are not executed in teardown\r\n    END\r\n    Do Operation\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor a couple of checks that's ok, but when there are more failure conditions (esp later in the flow - like depending on storage data), this gets ugly:\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n    IF   $condition     \r\n        Fail    failing text\r\n        RETURN     # just so the next lines are not executed in teardown\r\n    END\r\n    ${check}=     Do Check In SQL\r\n    IF   not $check     \r\n        Fail    check failed\r\n        RETURN     # just so the next lines are not executed in teardown\r\n    END\r\n    #

This is done to avoid huge messages messing up logs and reports, but the problem is that some valuable information may be lost. Another issue is that even the resulting messages are somewhat long and take lot of space.\r\n\r\nThe above is an old problem, but the situation is getting worse in RF 7.0 due failure messages being shown not only with tests,but also with each keyword and control structure. Earlier keywords and control structures in the result model didn't have a message at all, but it was added as part of the result model cleanup (#4883). The motivation was this:\r\n- We are adding JSON representation to the result model (#4847) and want the model to be as stable and future-proof as possible.\r\n- We likely want to in the future allow running individual keywords outside Robot core. At that point we want the result model to have a message, not only status as earlier.\r\n- In some special cases (at least with `--flatten-keywords` and `--remove-keywords`) we want to add some extra notes to result objects. Earlier we used documentation for that, but it was odd because control structures such as FOR loops cannot otherwise have a documentation. Using the message for this purpose works much better.\r\n\r\nNow that also keywords and control structures also have a message, the same message can be shown on multiple levels in the log file. That's rather annoying in general, but gets especially irritating if the message is long. To mitigate this issue, and to fix the old issue with long messages, I propose we do the following:\r\n\r\n1. Show only the beginning of long failure messages in log and report by default. I believe we should show so much that typical messages are shown fully, but considerably less than 40 lines that is the current maximum. We could possibly also show more with tests than with keywords and control structures.\r\n2. Have some way to show the full message. Probably a simple \"Show more.\" button/link would be fine.\r\n3. Stop cutting long messages otherwise. This can increase output file sizes, but I doubt the difference is too big.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4931/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4931/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914","id":1963840069,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ851DdJF","number":4914,"title":"Enhance token types used by parsing model","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":39,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-12-08T22:58:34Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-10-26T15:34:56Z","updated_at":"2025-12-02T13:36:19Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","type":{"id":122831,"node_id":"IT_kwDOAAjDTM4AAd_P","name":"Feature","description":"A request, idea, or new functionality","color":"blue","created_at":"2024-01-25T09:13:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T08:31:31Z","is_enabled":true},"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"On the lowest level the parsing model consists of tokens having different types. For most parts types are fine, but we have identified few issues with them. We should go them through and do at least the following:\r\n\r\n1. When assigning variables, we sometimes use the type `VARIABLE` and sometimes `ASSIGN`. Issue  #4708 proposed changing the type used with FOR and EXCEPT AS variables from `VARIABLE` to `ASSIGN` to be consistent with variables created from keyword return values. This change was already done during the RF 7.0 development, but it was reverted because it turned out we still used `VARIABLE` with variables created in the Variables section and with the new VAR syntax and i wasn't possible to change also these types in RF 7.0. We need to check all places where variables are created and see can we use a common type in all cases and what that type would be.\r\n\r\n2. We currently use the type `ARGUMENT` with too many different tokens. For example, we use it with IF and WHILE conditions and with variable values in the Variables section and with the VAR syntax. This means that if we wanted to support conditional variable assignment like `VAR    ${x}    IF    $cond    y    ELSE    z` both `$cont` and `y` would have the `ARGUMENT` type. This in turn would make it unnecessarily hard to find the condition and value tokens. It's not certain is this kind of conditional variable assignment a good idea in general, but we should nevertheless change the token types so that implementation is possible. We could, for example, introduce a new `CONDITION` type to be used with all conditions.\r\n\r\n3. `RETURN` should be changed to mean the RETURN statement, not [Return] setting.\r\n\r\n4. There are some deprecated and unused token types we can remove. This includes `WITH_NAME`, `FORCE_TAGS`, `FATAL_ERROR`, `FATAL_INVALID_HEADER` and `RETURN_SETTING`.\r\n\r\n5. We should in general go through the token types and see do they make sense. The idea is to do a proper cleanup once and then try to keep the types stable.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4914/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4858","id":1885309238,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85wX4k2","number":4858,"title":"Remove support for singular section headers","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972220183,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4PFw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20small","name":"effort: small","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":39,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-12-08T22:58:34Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-09-07T07:47:27Z","updated_at":"2025-12-02T13:39:44Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","type":{"id":122831,"node_id":"IT_kwDOAAjDTM4AAd_P","name":"Feature","description":"A request, idea, or new functionality","color":"blue","created_at":"2024-01-25T09:13:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T08:31:31Z","is_enabled":true},"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"Singular section headers were deprecated in RF 6.0 (#4431) and started to emit actual deprecation warnings in RF 7.0 (#4432).

have a situation where 2 test cases would like to import the same library with different arguments.\r\n\r\nMy library controls the mocking of something and depending on the test case, some component of the system-under-test is present in the mock or not. This is not an issue in other test suites because there the mocked components are static for the while suite. This particular test suite verifies the response to a lack of one or more of the components, so only there the mock is variable. This is why I'd prefer to stick with being able to specify the settings at import time rather than having to add extra keywords to set up the mock.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that, when using the keyword `Import Library` as is, the library is imported for the whole suite. The second time the same library is imported, even with different arguments, nothing happens. I think because it ends up with the same name the importer assumes nothing needs to happen.\r\n\r\nTo make things more confusing, the `__init__` of the library actually is called with the given arguments, so my logging indicated that the library was being initialized correctly. It would also help if this was eliminated if the library is not going to be used anyway.\r\n\r\nIdeally I'd like library imports to depend on the library scope, that way the library controls itself, but that would probably break comparability with other usecases. At the very least when an import does not actually do anything, I'd like to know about it. If possible a warning if the import arguments differ would already be a huge help. Now as far as I can find, nothing is logged anywhere.\r\n\r\nMy workaround for now is to import the libraries using `WITH NAME` and making sure the libraries are inert upon init. This is not ideal as it requires special attention that it counter-intuitive.\r\n\r\nTo aid in reproduction, I've attached a robot, library, and debug files as a

Depending on the keyboard layout, writing them can also require annoying finger acrobatics. It would thus be convenient if it would be possible to use `$var` instead of `${var}` and also `@list`, `&dict` and `%env` instead of `@{list}`, `&{dict}` and `%{env}`. For example, all these could be supported:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n$VARIABLE        value\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Log    $VARIABLE\r\n    $var =    Keyword\r\n    FOR    $item    IN    @stuff\r\n        Log    $item\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn all the above cases the `$var` syntax is used on its own and that would work fine. This syntax wouldn't work too well when embedded to a string, though. For example, if you have variables `$name` and `$named`, string `Hello, $name!` could be parsed like `Hello, ${name}!`, but `abc$named` could be either `abc${name}d` or `abc${named}`. We could require using the `${var}` syntax in cases where `$var` is ambiguous, that's how [shell scripts](https://learn-bash.org/variables.html) work, but I believe it's better to require it always when variables are embedded. That makes the syntax more consistent and this approach is also considerably easier to implement. We can, however, look at this again later if the `$var` syntax is universally considered better and using it always (when possible) is considered important.\r\n\r\nSupporting the `$var` syntax would be a backwards incompatible change, but if we support it only when variables are used on their own, it shouldn't be that bad. It would mean that all arguments starting with `$`, `@`, `&` and `%` would need to be escaped like `\\$not_var`. We already require this with `#` (which otherwise starts a comment) so there's precedence for such syntax. Nevertheless, this would break lot of tests/tasks and the change can be made only in a major version. It would also be a good idea to deprecate using arguments starting with these characters already earlier. If this enhancement is considered important, it could be added in RF 7.0 and deprecation added in RF 6.2 or possibly already in RF 6.1.\r\n\r\nAlthough the basic syntax would be simple, there are some design decision to be made:\r\n\r\n1. Should we limit variable base name to only alpha numeric characters and underscore? In other words, should something like `$! als lkjas` be considered a variable with base name `! als lkjat` or should the whole thing be considered a literal string? Being more strict with the variable name would mean there's less need for escaping, but then these variables would work inconsistently compared to \"normal\" variables. It would also mean that some built-in variables like `${/}` couldn't be used like `$/`. I got a feeling that it's better if we don't limit the name. \r\n2. Should this syntax support item access like `$list[0]` and `$dict[key][nested]`? I believe it should.\r\n3. Should this syntax support \"extended variable syntax\" like `$var.upper()` and `$SPACE * 10`? I don't have too strong opinion on this, but I guess it would be better to support it. Needing to use `${var.upper()}` in this case would be a bit strange and inconsistent.\r\n\r\nI'll add this issue tentatively to RF 7.0 scope, but we still need to make a bit more official decision about it. If we decide to include it, then another issue should be submitted about deprecating arguments starting with `$` and other such variable meta characters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/reactions","total_count":10,"+1":5,"-1":4,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4624","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4624/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4624/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4624/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4624","id":1561476634,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85dEj4a","number":4624,"title":" Limit Variable Scope within resource files ","user":{"login":"rhx-ch","id":12427567,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjEyNDI3NTY3","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/12427567?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhx-ch","html_url":"https://github.com/rhx-ch","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhx-ch/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhx-ch/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhx-ch/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhx-ch/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhx-ch/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhx-ch/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhx-ch/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhx-ch/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhx-ch/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430421,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzA0MjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20critical","name":"priority: critical","color":"00441b","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972226383,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4nTw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20extra%20large","name":"effort: extra large","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":39,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-12-08T22:58:34Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":3,"created_at":"2023-01-29T22:10:52Z","updated_at":"2025-05-20T11:50:07Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"Presently it's not possible to limit the scope of variables defined within resource files variable section to the resource file itself.

automatic argument conversion (#2890) makes it possible to have a keywords like\r\n```python\r\ndef accept_list(arg: list):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\ndef accept_dict(arg: dict):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nand call them so that argument are Python literals\r\n```\r\nAccept List    ['list', 'items', 'here']\r\nAccept Dict    {'key': 'value', 'another': 'item'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty convenient, but needing to use Python syntax is a bit ugly in general and especially annoying when using embedded arguments that are supposed to enhance readability:\r\n```\r\nSelect animals ['cat', 'dog'] from list\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose we enhance argument conversion so that we support also the following syntax:\r\n```\r\nAccept List    list, items, here\r\nAccept Dict    key=value, another=item\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe high level semantics would be as follows:\r\n\r\n- Separator between items is a comma _and_ a space. This allows using commas in values like `first, second,with,commas, third`. Having a comma followed by a space in the value wouldn't be possible.\r\n- We could allow using a semicolon and a space as an alternative separator. In that case we'd use the separator that's encountered first. This would allow usages like `first; second, with, commas followed by spaces; third`.\r\n- With dictionaries the separator between key and value is `=`. This is the syntax we use also when creating `&{dict}` variables.\r\n- Values are considered strings by default. This can be changed by using generics (#4433) and `TypedDict` (#4477).\r\n- Because this would be handled by type convertors, variables would have been resolved already earlier. That means that something like `${1}, ${2}` wouldn't create a list of integers. See the above point for alternatives.\r\n- Also escapes are handled before type conversion. That makes it impossible to use something like `first, second\\,with\\,commas` for escaping commas in values.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement would ease using collections a lot especially if #4433 and #4477 are implemented. If we agree above semantics are fine, implementation would also be pretty easy. I thus add this to RF 5.1 scope even though the release is already late.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4478/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4472","id":1379984865,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85SQOXh","number":4472,"title":"Allow resource files and libraries to be imported privately in other resource files","user":{"login":"BCGST","id":105816460,"node_id":"U_kgDOBk6hjA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/105816460?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST","html_url":"https://github.com/BCGST","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/BCGST/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972226383,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4nTw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20extra%20large","name":"effort: extra large","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":39,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-12-08T22:58:34Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":15,"created_at":"2022-09-20T20:55:41Z","updated_at":"2024-09-10T10:47:33Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"It could be beneficial if users could import resource files and libraries in a \"private\" way.

the other library and cause the opposing library crash the test when they reach the unexpected keyword.\r\n\r\nIn more biased terms, private importation of libraries and resources feels like a much

currently have three settings for controlling tags tests get:\r\n\r\n- `Force Tags` in the Settings section for specifying tags tests will unconditionally get.\r\n- `Default Tags` in the Settings sections for specifying tags tests get, in addition to the forced tags, unless tests themselves have tags.\r\n- `[Tags]` with each tests to specify tags they get in addition to the forced tags. These also override the default tags.\r\n\r\nThis is rather complicated and my understanding is that all three settings are rarely used. I propose we simplify this so that in the future we'd only have two settings:\r\n\r\n- `Test Tags` in the Settings section to specify tags tests always get. Same as `Force Tags` nowadays.\r\n- `[Tags]` with each test to specify tags tests get in addition to the `Test Tags`.\r\n\r\nThe functional difference compared to the current behavior is that there wouldn't be a possibility to specify tags tests get by default but that they could override when needed. For example, something like this wouldn't be possible anymore:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nForce Tags      all have\r\nDefault Tags    most have\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nT1\r\n    No Operation\r\nT2\r\n    [Tags]    only one has\r\n    No Operation\r\nT3\r\n    No Operation\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead of using `Default Tags` that some tests override, all tests that actually need these tags must list them explicitly. The change wouldn't be overly big and I actually like this better:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Settings ***\r\nTest Tags      all have\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nT1\r\n    [Tags]    most have\r\n    No Operation\r\nT2\r\n    [Tags]    only one has\r\n    No Operation\r\nT3\r\n    [Tags]    most have\r\n    No Operation\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change is obviously backwards incompatible and cannot be done without a deprecation period. I propose we do it like this:\r\n- In RF 5.1 add `Test Tags` that basically acts as an alias for `Force Tags`. Also document that `Test Tags` and `[Tags]` are the way forward.\r\n- In RF 6.0 deprecate `Force Tags` and `Default Tags`.\r\n- In RF 7.0 remove `Force Tags` and `Default Tags`.\r\n\r\nThis is currently only a proposal and comments are welcome!

For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing('example')\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords. It is possible to use `BuiltIn.run_keyword` to execute other keywords so that they are shown as child keywords and #4237 discusses better APIs for that usage.\r\n\r\nA problem with using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` is that keywords executed with it must be available as normal keywords either in the library running other keywords or in some other imported library. That's ok if keywords are usable on their own, but it is possible that child keywords cannot be used like that. This problem can be avoided by making it possible to run any callable as the [final proposal](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237#issuecomment-1058077142) in #4237 suggests. There could, however, be even better solutions for the underlying need.\r\n\r\nA solution I have been thinking is is using a context manager that would create a keyword in log (and in output.xml). We probably could use our existing `robot.result.Keyword` for that purpose. The usage could be something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    with Keyword('Do first thing', args=['example'], doc='Example'):\r\n        do_first_thing()\r\n    with Keyword('Do second thing'):\r\n        print('No need to call a method, implementation can be directly inside the context manager!')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the main benefits of this approach compared to `BuitlIn.run_keyword` would be:\r\n1. No need to expose child keywords as real keywords.\r\n2. No need to even make each child keyword a callable. Implementation could be directly inside the context manager.\r\n3. It would be possible to add documentation, tags, etc. to be shown in the log file.\r\n\r\nPoints 1. and 3. would be possible also with `execute_keyword` proposed in #4237. Executing other keywords has also other use cases than logging child keywords, so #4237 is likely needed anyway. It's not certain is 2. alone worth enough to implement this feature. Possibly using a context manager could result with cleaner code, though.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4252/reactions","total_count":5,"+1":5,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4252/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237","id":1140704583,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85D_cVH","number":4237,"title":"Better API for library keywords to execute other keywords","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972225384,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4jaA","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20large","name":"effort: large","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/70","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/70/labels","id":9838128,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Alh4w","number":70,"title":"v8.0","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":39,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-08-25T10:17:24Z","updated_at":"2025-12-08T22:58:34Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":10,"created_at":"2022-02-16T23:50:50Z","updated_at":"2023-08-25T11:29:11Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","type":null,"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"It is a relatively common need for library keywords to be able to run other keywords. One good example is SeleniumLibrary, that makes it possible to register a keyword that will be executed if any of its own keywords fails. Sometimes, especially when doing task automation, it is also beneficial to log actions done by the keyword in the log file separately. For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing()\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords, but there are sometimes needs to show `do_first_thing` and `do_second_thing` as child keywords.\r\n\r\nNowadays keywords can execute other keywords by using `BuiltIn.run_keyword`. It works but has several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Arguments are resolved twice. This  means replacing variables and handling syntax like `\\n`. For example, if we have a keyword like\r\n    ```python\r\n    def example(arg):\r\n        BuiltIn().run_keyword('Log To Console', arg)\r\n    ```\r\n    and call it like\r\n    ```\r\n    Example    c:\\\\temp\r\n    ```\r\n    the actually logged string has a tab character. The reason is that `\\\\t` is first resolved to string `\\t` which is then on the second round resolved to a tab.\r\n\r\n    Double resolving can be avoided be registering the keyword to be a \"run keyword variant\", but that API isn't really public and it's also pretty bad in general. We have #2190 about enhancing it and making it public, but it would probably be better to avoid this double resolving altogether.\r\n\r\n2. Related to above, the keyword using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` cannot safely call it without escaping strings. For example, something like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Log To Console', 'c:\\\\temp')` won't work correctly and the argument should be `c:\\\\\\\\temp` instead.\r\n\r\n3. `BuiltIn.run_keyword` only accepts positional arguments. For example, if we had a keyword implemented like\r\n    ```pyhton\r\n    def example(upper=False):\r\n        ...\r\n    ```\r\n    we couldn't call it like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Example', upper=True)` but instead needed to use `BuiltIn.run_keywod('Example', 'upper=True')`.\r\n\r\nThe above examples ought to make it clear that a better API is needed. I have some ideas how to API could look and will write separate comments about that a bit later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/reactions","total_count":2,"+1":2,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4170","id":1080815625,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Aa_AJ","number":4170,"title":"Tests

Framework data typically uses the whitespace-separated format that looks like this:\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Keyword    arg1    arg2\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition to that, we support also the pipe-separated format like:\r\n```robotframework\r\n| *** Test Cases *** |\r\n| Example |\r\n| | Keyword | arg1 | arg2 |\r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth of these formats have been supported equally long, since RF 2.1.1 (#375), and they can also be mixed withing a single file because the format is determined based on does a line start with a `|` or not. In practice the latter syntax is very rarely used and I don't even remember when I have seen it used anywhere except in our tests that validate that the syntax works.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is to remove the support for the pipe-separated format in order to make the syntax simpler. The main motivation is making it easier to implement new parsers for Robot Framework. It would help making external parsers, for example, for syntax highlighting purposes and it would also make it a lot easier to create a faster parser for Robot itself using C, Rust or Go. The motivation behind #5198 is exactly the same and that issue explains this situation in more detail.\r\n\r\nAlthough this syntax is rarely used, I'm certain it's used _somewhere_ and removing the syntax is obviously backwards incompatible.

first.\r\n\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5199/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5199/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1}]}},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/82","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/82","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/82/labels","id":13140005,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84AyIAl","number":82,"title":"v7.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":14,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2025-06-24T22:58:16Z","updated_at":"2025-12-05T19:30:55Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null,"issues":{"total_count":14,"incomplete_results":false,"items":[{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5566","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5566/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5566/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5566/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5566","id":3674268402,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ87bAOLy","number":5566,"title":"Libdoc:

shows documentation for recognized types used as arguments and, since RF 7.0 (#3017), as return types. There are four kind of recognized types:\n\n- Standard types (`str`, `list`, `Path`, ...)\n- Enums\n- TypedDicts\n- Custom types\n\nWith standard types the shown documentation is part of the Libdoc implementation and with the other types the docs come from the types themselves and are written by library developers.\n\nThis system works well in general, but if the same type is used with arguments and also as a return type, writing good documentation that covers both usages can be problematic. Argument type documentation should in general specify what arguments are allowed, while the return type documentation should explain how the return value can be used, what kind of attributes custom objects have, and so on.\n\nA solution to this problem is making it possible to have separate documentation for argument types and return types. This is what getting it done requires in high level:\n1. Design how to store separate argument and return type docs in Libdoc spec files.\n2. Update Libdoc HTML UI accordingly.\n3. Write return type docs for standard types.\n4. Design how other types can specify return type docs. Currently docs are got from class or function docstrings, and we could support some marker there that would separate different docs. Alternatively classes/functions could have a custom attribute like `type_doc` that could be a two-tuple with argument and return type docs

from https://github.com/oracle/graalpython seems to work well enough so that official support for RobotFramework would be useful.\n\nGraalPython allows for better testing of JVM based APIs, given that GraalPython itself runs on JVM and supports inheriting from Java classes, in a similar way as Jython did in RF 4.\n\nThe upcoming release 25 of GraalPython seems to have fixed outstanding issues the prevented running RFs own regression tests.\n\nUsing the early access release:\nhttps://github.com/graalvm/graal-languages-ea-builds/releases/download/graalpy-25.0.0-ea.09/graalpy-25.0.0-ea.09-linux-amd64.tar.gz\nOn RedHat 9.5 I got  6768 tests, 6622 passed, 146 failed\n\n\n**Notes on running the RF acceptance tests with GraalPython:**\n\nAssumes graal-python unpacked in current dir, as well as robotframework source:\n\nCreate a virtual env with GraalPy:\n  \n  ./graalpy-25.0.0-dev-linux-amd64/bin/python -m venv genv\n  source genv/bin/activate\n  pip install -r robotframework/atest/requirements.txt   # If gcc, patch, libxml2-devel and libxslt-devel are installed, lxml should compile for fine for GraalPy\n  deactivate\n  \nRun with CPython virtual env, where robotframework/atest/requirements-run.txt have been installed  (jsonschema failed to install for GraalPy)\n  \n  cd robotframework\n  python atest/run.py --interpreter ../genv/bin/python\n\nNote that graalpython startup is slow and many tests are very short, so this make cumulative execution time for the tests slow.\n\n\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5347/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5347/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5338","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5338/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5338/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5338/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5338","id":2844709049,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86pjtC5","number":5338,"title":"User

parsing model supports setting errors for individual tokens, but there are two problems with the current approach:\r\n\r\n1. Errors (typically syntax errors) aren't separated from warnings (typically deprecations). This caused a problem when deprecating singular section headers (#4432) and the code reporting the warning as part of execution needed to know [what errors can occur in different contexts](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/d007855fea4957031cb952c4157fa36dfb3b7228/src/robot/running/builder/transformers.py#L516) to handle the problem. With the planned deprecation of the pipe-separated format (#5203) this is likely even a bigger problem, because there's no single context where pipes can be used.\r\n2. It isn't easy to recognize if the same error/warning occurs multiple times in same file. This requires comparing messages, but because they typically contain some variables parts, they cannot be compared directly. Searching for a certain sub-string is also problematic, because error messages can change.\r\n\r\nMy proposal for solving both of the above problems is adding new `errno` attribute to to the `Token` objects with the following semantics:\r\n1. `errno` is an integer representing an error code.\r\n2. Each error and warning has a different code.\r\n3. Codes have constant names like `ERR_SINGULAR_HEADER_DEPRECATED` stored as attributes of the `Token` class.\r\n4.

are planning to support `$var` syntax in addition to `${var}` in the future (#4674). The plan was to do that already in RF 7.0, but it turned out that this would be too badly backwards incompatible. Probably the biggest problem would be that the Browser library accepts passwords in format `$secret` and resolves the variable value internally to avoid the value being logged automatically. After the planned change `$secret`, would be considered exactly the same as `${secret}` meaning that a confidential value could leak.\r\n\r\nWe still believe that supporting the `$var` syntax is a good idea, but we need to first deprecate using values starting with `$` or any other variable identifier. That means that using, for example,\r\n```\r\nLog Many    $value    @another\r\n```\r\nwill cause a deprecation warning and the value needs to be escaped like\r\n```\r\nLog Many    \\$value    \\@another\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4909/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":2,"-1":1,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4909/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4857","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4857/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4857/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4857/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4857","id":1885247571,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85wXphT","number":4857,"title":"Enhance detecting keyword names used in arguments of other keywords (e.g. `Wait Until Keyword Succeeds`)","user":{"login":"rubenss87","id":143520332,"node_id":"U_kgDOCI3yTA","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/143520332?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenss87","html_url":"https://github.com/rubenss87","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenss87/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenss87/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenss87/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenss87/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenss87/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenss87/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenss87/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenss87/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rubenss87/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/82","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/82","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/82/labels","id":13140005,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84AyIAl","number":82,"title":"v7.5","description":"","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","user_view_type":"public","site_admin":false},"open_issues":14,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2025-06-24T22:58:16Z","updated_at":"2025-12-05T19:30:55Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":9,"created_at":"2023-09-07T07:06:36Z","updated_at":"2025-12-06T07:42:04Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"NONE","type":{"id":122831,"node_id":"IT_kwDOAAjDTM4AAd_P","name":"Feature","description":"A request, idea, or new functionality","color":"blue","created_at":"2024-01-25T09:13:35Z","updated_at":"2024-10-08T08:31:31Z","is_enabled":true},"active_lock_reason":null,"sub_issues_summary":{"total":0,"completed":0,"percent_completed":0},"issue_dependencies_summary":{"blocked_by":0,"total_blocked_by":0,"blocking":0,"total_blocking":0},"body":"When I try detect all keywords to see if are included in dependencies files with libraries (/robot/parsing/model/statements.py), if a keyword is inside of \"**Wait Until Keyword Succeeds**\", for example:\r\n\r\n    Wait Until Keyword Succeeds    1s    0.2\r\n    ...

standard way to get object length in Python is using `len(obj)`, but with old Jython versions some Java based objects didn't support it. If I remember correctly, you needed to use the `size()` method with Java based mappings and the `length` attribute with Java based arrays. As the result the BuiltIn keyword `Get Length` currently uses this kind of a helper method for getting the length:\n\n```python\ndef _get_length(self, item: Any) -> int:\n    try:\n        return len(item)\n    except Exception:\n        try:\n            return item.length()\n        except Exception:\n            try:\n                return item.size()\n            except Exception:\n                try:\n                    return item.length\n                except Exception:\n                    raise RuntimeError(f\"Could not get length of '{item}'.\")\n```\n\nThis makes no sense anymore for the following reasons:\n- We haven't supported Jython for ages.\n- Newer Jython 2.x versions didn't have that problem. It was probably fixed in Jython 2.5.\n- If someone is using a custom Python class without `__len__` but with any of the above methods/attributes, they should fix their code.\n\nLet's deprecated all the other ways to get the length than using `len(obj)`.

if we have a keyword like\n```python\ndef example(arg: str):\n    print(arg)\n```\nand use it with bytes like `b\"hello\"`, automatic argument conversion converts the value to a string simply by calling `str(value)`. This means that the keyword ends up getting a string `\"b'hello'\"`. The conversion can be tested on the interpreter:\n```python\n>>> str(b\"hello\")\n\"b'hello'\"\n```\n\nThis isn't very useful and can cause quite a lot of confusion. The keyword seems to work, or at least argument conversion doesn't fail, but the actual value is most likely not what expected.\n\nA much better approach is mapping each bytes to a matching Unicode code point. This means that bytes like `b\"hello\"` is converted to a string `\"hello\"`. This can be demonstrated as below:\n```python\n>>> \"\".join(chr(o) for o in b\"hello\")\n'hello'\n>>> b\"hello\".decode(\"latin-1\")  # simpler and faster than the above\n'hello'\n```\n\nA major benefit of this approach is that it is symmetric to how strings are converted to bytes if you have a keyword that accepts `arg: bytes` and call it with a string like `\"hello\"`. Simply calling `bytes(\"hello\")` wouldn't even work and argument conversion uses `\"hello\".encode(\"latin-1\")` that yields `b\"hello\"`.\n\nAnother possible approach would be explicitly rejecting bytes when an argument has `str` as its type. I can see some benefits in that, but it would be inconsistent with how argument conversion works in general and especially how it works in `str` to `bytes` conversion already now.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5567/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5567/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5565","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5565/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5565/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5565/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5565","id":3674186389,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ87a_6KV","number":5565,"title":"Libdoc:

shows documentation for recognized types used as arguments and, since RF 7.0 (#3017), also as return types. There are four kind of recognized types:\n- Standard types (`str`, `list`, `Path`, ...)\n- Enums\n- TypedDicts\n- Custom types\n\nWith standard types the shown documentation is part of Libdoc implementation and with all the others documentation is written by library developers. Standard type docs have been written with an idea to help users to be able to use correct values as arguments. For example, this is the documentation for the `bool` type:\n\n> Strings ``TRUE``, ``YES``, ``ON``, ``1`` and possible localization specific \"true strings\" are converted to Boolean ``True``, the empty string, strings ``FALSE``, ``NO``, ``OFF`` and ``0`` and possibly localization specific \"false strings\" are converted to Boolean ``False``, and the string ``NONE`` is converted to the Python ``None`` object. Other strings and all other values are passed as-is, allowing keywords to handle them specially if needed. All string comparisons are case-insensitive.\n>\n> Examples: ``TRUE`` (converted to ``True``), ``off`` (converted to ``False``), ``example`` (used as-is)\n\nAs the example above illustrates, standard type docs work well with arguments, but not at all with return types. There are three ways we could make the situation better:\n\n1. Update all standard library docs so that they also talk about the usage as a return value. This would require no code changes, but I'm afraid the resulting docs wouldn't work well either with arguments or with return types.\n2. Add separate argument type and return type documentation. This would be the best solution, but it requires some design and implementation work and there's no time for it in RF 7.4. I'll submit an issue about this and assign it to RF 7.5 scope.\n3. Don't show documentation with standard types used as return types in Libdoc HTML UI. This is pretty simple UI change and can still be done in RF 7.4. The change obviously needs to be reverted once it is possible to have separate return value types.\n\nThis change should only be done with standard types, because with others the user written documentation may very well work as a return type documentation. For example, the XML library just got typing (#5541) and many of its keyword are typed to return a custom `Element` type that has custom type documentation.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5565/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5565/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5563","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5563/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5563/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5563/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5563","id":3668138391,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ87ao1mX","number":5563,"title":"Argument

encountered \"Adding keyword\" error when upgrading robotframework (from v7.0.1 to v7.3.2). It took me a while to figure out the trigger is not a `Union`, but a `Callable` with empty argument list. Looking at robotframework code, my impression is that type hints involving `Callable` are not explicitly supported, but the argument list is treated as \"nested\", thus mostly processed as a `Union`, which happens to work unless the argument list is empty. I guess this will be fixed by adding better support for `Callable`.\n\nBut as this took me some time to investigate, I figured I should open an Issue so internet search can help other people. I did not bisect for the first affected version, so this might be old news.\n\nHere is a reproducer, also showing the workaround of using ellipsis instead of empty list:\n```\n$ robot --version\nRobot Framework 7.3.2 (Python 3.14.0 on linux)\n\n$ cat m.robot\n*** Settings ***\n| Library | Funcs\n\n***Test Cases***\n| Calling Test\n| | ${func} = | Get Func\n| | Call Func | ${func}\n\n$ cat Funcs.py\nfrom typing import Callable\n\ndef get_func() -> Callable[..., None]:\n    def func() -> None:\n        return\n    return func\n\ndef call_func(func: Callable[..., None]) -> None:\n    func()\n\n$ robot m.robot\n==============================================================================\nM\n==============================================================================\nCalling Test                                                          | PASS |\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nM                                                                     | PASS |\n1 test, 1 passed, 0 failed\n\n$ cat Funcs.py\nfrom typing import Callable\n\ndef get_func() -> Callable[[], None]:\n    def func() -> None:\n        return\n    return func\n\ndef call_func(func: Callable[..., None]) -> None:\n    func()\n\n$ robot m.robot\n[ ERROR ] Error in library 'Funcs': Adding keyword 'get_func' failed: Union cannot be empty.\n==============================================================================\nM\n==============================================================================\nCalling Test                                                          | FAIL |\nNo keyword with name 'Get Func' found.\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nM                                                                     | FAIL |\n1 test, 0 passed, 1 failed\n```\nThe above started as a real console output, I just made small edits to improve readability, such as removing paths.

`Should Contain` keyword got bytes auto conversion support  as part of #5054. It works so that if the first argument to this keyword is `bytes` or `bytearray`, the second argument is automatically converted to `bytes` as well. This auto conversion supports strings (with ordinals below 256) and integers (in range 0-255). We are now adding this auto conversion support to various other keywords as part of #5548 and I noticed two problems with it:\n\n1. It's odd that auto conversion supports integer values (that supports creating only single bytes), but not lists of integers (that would allow allow creating byte sequences).\n2. Argument conversion when using `arg: bytes` only handles strings, so it's inconsistent with the bytes auto conversion. That inconsistency is now going to be more noticeable when more keywords get the auto conversion support.\n\nThe above problems will be resolved like this:\n1. Bytes auto conversion is enhanced to support also lists of integers, including lists of items that can be converted to integers. That is covered by #5548.\n2. We'll enhance argument conversion with bytes so that it supports same values as bytes auto conversion (i.e. integers and lists of items that can be converted to integers). That will be done as part of this issue.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5557/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5557/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5553","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5553/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5553/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5553/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5553","id":3647070065,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ87ZYd9x","number":5553,"title":"BuiltIn:

validation keywords in BuiltIn currently work with `bytes`, but that support is not explicitly documented or tested. There's generally no `bytes` compatibility code, but `bytes` just has lot of the same methods as `str`:\n```python\n>>> b'FOO'.lower().startswith(b'f')\nTrue\n```\n\nNow that we are adding typing to BuiltIn (#5544), this `bytes` compatibility will be broken if we type arguments as `str`. That would be bad, because it is likely that these keywords are used with `bytes` even though the `bytes` support isn't advertised. A good example is #5054 that added `bytes` related enhancement to `Should Contain`. The problem described in this issue wouldn't occur with `Should Contain`, though, because it accepts also other values than strings (and bytes) and will likely be typed as `object`. Keywords like `Should Start With` that only make sense with strings (and bytes) are in bigger risk.\n\nThis is what we need to do:\n1. Make sure keywords that work with `bytes` get typing `str | bytes` instead of just `str`. This preserves the current functionality.\n2. Add tests. This makes sure current functionality isn't accidentally broken later.\n3. Fix possible API compatibility issues between `bytes` and `str` when feasible. For example, case-insensitivity is implemented with `str.casefold`, but `bytes` don't have that method and `bytes.lower` should be used instead. This particular problem is easy to fix with a helper method, in others we may just document that certain feature doesn't work with bytes.\n4. Consider enhancing `bytes` support when feasible. For example, `Should Start With` currently works if both the validated value and the expected start value are `bytes`, but validating `bytes` so that the expected value is `str` fails with a `TypeError`. The aforementioned #5054 enhanced `Should Contain` in this regard and doing same enhancement with other `bytes` compatible keywords would be nice.\n5. Update documentation. Using `str | bytes` type hint already documents that `bytes` can be used, but adding some documentation about converting expected values could still be good. Concrete enhancements also require \"New in RF 7.4.\"

we have a keyword like\n```python\ndef example(arg: int | None = None):\n    ...\n```\ncalling it like\n```\nExample    ${EMPTY}\n```\nfails, because an empty string cannot be converted to an integer or `None`. This itself isn't a huge problem, but it also means that if the keyword is used inside a user keyword like\n```robotframework\n*** Keywords ***\nUser keyword\n    [Arguments]    ${arg}=\n    Example    ${arg}\n```\nthe usage fails if the user keyword is called without an argument. Also that isn't a huge problem in general, because the keyword signature could be changed to use `${arg}=None` instead of `${arg}=`.\n\nThe main problem with the current behavior is that there can be backwards compatibility problems if a keyword that originally had an argument `arg=None` is changed to use `arg: int | None = None`. We have this exact problem with `Convert To Integer` and other similar BuiltIn keywords that currently accept `base=None`, but that should be changed to use `base: int | None = None` instead when adding typing to BuiltIn (#5544). Tests for these keywords use user keywords accepting `${base}=` and they break after typing is added. Fixing these tests would be trivial, but also others can be affected this change so I believe it's better to change argument conversion so that an empty string is converted to `None` instead.\n\nTo make sure the change is backwards compatible, I believe we should support empty string to `None` conversion only when typing is added explicitly, not if typing is got from a default value like `arg=None`. If also did with types got from default values, empty strings passed to such keywords would be converted to `None` which is not desirable.. If we only change this with explicit typing, there cannot be backwards compatibility issues because earlier using an empty string didn't work at all. Notice also that the change does not affect usages like `arg: str | None`, because in such cases an empty string is accepted without conversion anyway.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5545/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5545/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5543","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5543/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5543/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5543/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5543","id":3617639899,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ87XoM3b","number":5543,"title":"Libdoc:

keywords in standard libraries, at least in String and Collections, allow using an empty string so that it is interpreted to mean the same as not using the argument at all. For example, all these usages are equal:\n\n```robotframework\n*** Test Cases ***\nExample\n    Get Slice From List    ${list}    0    2\n    Get Slice From List    ${list}    ${EMPTY}    2\n    Get Slice From List    ${list}    end=2\n```\n\nThis made sense in the early days when tests were created in tables and when the named argument syntax (`end=2`) wasn't supported. It that usage these were equivalent:\n\n| Test Case | Keyword | Argument | Argument | Argument |\n| --- | ------ | --- | -- | --- |\n| Example | Get Slice From List | ${list} | 0 | 2 |\n| | Get Slice From List | ${list} |    | 2 |\n\nIn practice the idea was to avoid the need to specify the default value in data. Nowadays the named argument syntax works much better.\n\nThis old syntax hasn't bothered much earlier, but now that we are adding type hints to standard libraries, continuing to support it requires using annoying typing like `start: int | Literal[\"\"]` instead of simpler `start: int`. I believe that's enough reason to warrant deprecating the syntax in RF 7.4. We can wait at least to RF 8.0, possibly later, before removing it.

Collections has various keywords (e.g. `Sort List`, `Append To List`) that mutate the argument they get and return no value. This works fine when they are used with mutable values (typically lists and dictionaries) and using immutable values (e.g. tuples) currently fails. These failures are not reported too nicely, so the current situation isn't great in this regard.\n\n- We are now adding type hints to Collections (#5527) and argument conversion will be done based on them. For example, if we add typing `list` to the `Sort List` keyword, it can be used with any iterable argument and the argument is converted to a list. The resulting list will then be sorted, but the original value is not affected and thus in practice nothing happens.\n\nKeywords that seem to work but actually do nothing are even worse than keyword that fail with a bad error message, so just adding type hints makes the situation with using these keywords with immutable arguments worse. A simple way to make the situation better is changing these keywords so that they return the value in addition to modifying it. That way these keywords can be used with any iterable/mapping, not on with list/dict.\n\nThe change itself is trivial and adding tests isn't hard either. Probably the most challenging task is documenting the behavior so that users understand what's happening. I think it would be best to add a section about this to the general library documentation. A simple note referring to that section can then be added to each affected keyword if needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5536/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5536/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5535","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5535/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5535/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5535/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5535","id":3581421859,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ87VeCkj","number":5535,"title":"Make

`Sequence` conversion is handled by the same converter as `list` and `Mapping` by the same converter as `dict`. In most cases this works fine, but there are subtle issues with handling non list/dict values as well as in error reporting. These issues were noticed when adding typing to the Collections library (#5527) that is likely to need both concrete types (`list/tuple`) and abstract types (`Sequence/Mapping`).\n\nIn general `list/dict` converters should make sure the end result is `list/dict`, while `Sequence/Mapping` converters should preserve the original sequence type. An exception to the latter rule is that if typing is `MutableSequence/MutableMapping`, possible immutable values must be converted to `list/dict`.\n\nThe easiest way to fix these issues is adding separate converters for `Sequence` and `Mapping`. They will be very similar to `list` and `dict` converters, and it is probably possible to refactor the code so that the later extend the former.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5531/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5531/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5529","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5529/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5529/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5529/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5529","id":3566247373,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ87UkJ3N","number":5529,"title":"Add

Python's typing `object` and `Any` are in many ways similar, but there are subtle differences making one better than the other in certain context. We added an explicit converter that does nothing for `Any` in RF 6.1 and the reasons explained in #4647 apply also to `object`. In addition to that, the current situation is inconsistent.\n\nA [comment](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4647#issuecomment-1419600541) in the aforementioned issues explains why adding a converter for a currently unrecognized type is backwards-incompatible. In practice the behavior changes so that if you have\n```python\ndef example(arg: object = 1):\n    ...\n```\nthere's no conversion attempted based on the default value type anymore. This kind of typing ought to be rare and the problem is easy to avoid by using `arg: int | object = 1` instead. I thus consider the change fine also in a non-major release.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5529/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5529/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5523","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5523/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5523/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5523/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5523","id":3532158420,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ87SiHXU","number":5523,"title":"Libdoc:

has gotten out of the way, the project I'm working on would really benefit from dynamically generated tests as otherwise I'd have to write 10+ of the same lines of code over and over. Some of the tests due to their nature take a lot of time to run and it would be nice if it would be possible to allow dynamically generated tests to honor the --include tag filter as it would allow to only run the necessary generated tests during development instead of waiting around for extra unnecessary tests to execute.\n\nI do hope that this issue is not too much of a bother, and thank you for

in suite, test and keyword header are vertically misaligned a bit. They should be vertically centered, but some items are a bit too high and others a bit too low.\n\nThis is how the header looks in Chrome:\n<img width=\"1876\" height=\"164\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/95794051-cc59-45f2-9130-200d00748528\" />\n\nWith Firefox the issue is quite a bit worse:\n<img width=\"1879\" height=\"146\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/335cec45-93f3-4ea9-9f54-574711484f7a\" />\n\nI've noticed this issue already earlier, but it became more apparent when I tested PR #5016 that fixes #4888. After investigating why the problem occurs, I noticed two things:\n\n1. The header implementation is pretty complicated with various divs, spans, absolutely positioned elements, and so on. It is possible to refactor it to use [CSS flexible box layout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_flexible_box_layout).\n2. Firefox seems to [align text higher than other browsers](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75238633/text-position-is-higher-in-its-bounding-box-on-firefox-vs-other-browsers).

was fiddling with tags and I noticed a slight inconsistency between documentation and tags.\nYou can remove tags in keywords by specifying \"-\" at the start of them in `[Tags]`. The framework also allows to specify tags from the documentation, but it seems that then the removal mechanism does not apply there.\n\nIn the following example, the keyword will display in the report the tags: `Beta,-Beta,Charlie,Delta` instead of `Charlie, Delta`.\n```\n*** Settings ***\nKeyword Tags       Alpha    Beta\n\n*** Test Cases ***\nSecond test\n    Some keyword\n\n*** Keywords

the `ExecutionResult` factory method is used like\n```python\nfrom robot.api import ExecutionResult\n\nresult = ExecutionResult('output.json', include_keywords=False)\n```\nthe `result` object actually contains all keyword data. This isn't a big problem with normal results, but with big results the amount of memory that's used unnecessary can be pretty big. More importantly, the memory and time spend parsing the keyword data is totally wasted.\n\nWith XML outputs the `include_keywords` argument works so that the keyword elements are discarded already early during XML parsing. This can save a huge amount of memory compared to first parsing these elements and then pruning them from the generated result model. With JSON we can have similar effect by using the `object_hook` argument with [json.load](https://docs.python.org/3/library/json.html#json.load). This hook allows removing `body`, `setup` and `teardown` before the result model is created. Based on my tests after the initial implementation the effect is about the same as with XML.\n\nThis issue mostly affects the programmatic usage where keywords aren't needed, but there are at least two cases where it has an effect also with normal Robot usage:\n- Using `--rerunfailed(suites)` when the original results are in JSON format.\n- Using Rebot to generate only the report file when results are in JSON format.\n\nI noticed this issue when studying #5464. The root cause with both of these options is that omitting and flattening keywords was imply not taken into account when the JSON output support was added.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5467/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5467/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5466","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5466/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5466/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5466/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5466","id":3196823310,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86-i6cO","number":5466,"title":"`--flattenkeywords`

reproduce:\n\n```python\n>>> suite = running.TestSuite('root')\n>>> suite.suites.append(result.TestSuite('child'))\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n[...]\nTypeError: Only <member '_name' of 'TestSuite' objects> objects accepted, got child.\n```\n\nThis can happen when modifying suite structures, for example, using pre-run modifiers and using incompatible items. The error is so bad that it makes it hard to understand how to fix the problem.\n\nThe reason for the _really_ strange `<member '_name' of 'TestSuite' objects>` part in the error message is that our `type_name` utility considers `_name` attribute special and uses its value as the name if an item has it. This special handling is there to properly handle typing special forms (`Any`, `Union`, ...), and it is used also with `TestSuite` that happens to have `_name`. The `type_name` utility needs to be enhanced so that it checks for `_name` only with special forms, not with other objects.\n\nAfter fixing `type_name`, the error gets less strange but isn't too useful either:\n```\nTypeError: Only TestSuite objects accepted, got TestSuite.\n```\nThis is due to `type_name` returning `'TestSuite'` both for `running.TestSuite` and `result.TestSuite`. I don't think it makes sense to change `type_name` in this regard, but we can change the code emitting error to use a custom utility that contains also the module part. I got this now fixed locally and the error is this:\n```\nTypeError: Only 'robot.running.TestSuite' objects accepted, got 'robot.result.TestSuite'.\n```","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5433/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5433/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5432","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5432/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5432/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5432/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5432","id":3065700331,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ862ut_r","number":5432,"title":"Small

a library keyword calls another keyword by using `BuiltIn.run_keyword`, timeouts are deactivated and the calling keyword is not stopped if it takes too much time or even hangs. For example, this keyword hangs and timeouts cannot stop it:\n\n```python\ndef example():\n    BuiltIn().run_keyword(\"Log\", \"Hello!\")\n    while True:\n        time.sleep(0)\n```\n\nThis problem doesn't occur on Windows, because there the low level timeout implementation is different than on other platforms. The underlying reason is that outside Windows timeouts are implemented using signals that are enabled when a library keyword starts and disabled when it ends. When a library keyword calls another keyword via `BuiltIn.run_keyword`, timeouts are disabled when the called keyword ends. This is easy to fix by keeping count on how many times signals have been activated and deactivating them only when that count gets to zero.\n\nI noticed this when investigating how to prevent output files being corrupted if a library keywords uses `Builtin.run_keyword` and timeouts are used (#5417). This issue explains why that problem manifested itself only on Windows and with this issue fixed that problem occurs also elsewhere. That can be considered a bad and backwards incompatible thing, but I still believe it's better to fix this issue. If we want to fix #5417 by disabling timeouts if `BuiltIn.run_keyword` is used, we should do it explicitly and consistently on all platforms.

files can be corrupted if a timeout occurs when Robot is writing log messages. That is a serious issue, because it prevents creating normal log and report files. Investigating this kind of problems is also pretty annoying, because what happens depends on when exactly the timeout occurs. It could be that most times everything goes well, but now and then the output is corrupted.\n\nTo avoid these problems, we nowadays delay writing log messages when timeouts are enabled (#2839). Before we had this mechanism in place, the following example reproduced the problem pretty reliably regardless the operating system:\n\n```robotframework\n*** Settings ***\nLibrary     lib.py\n\n*** Test Cases ***\nTest\n    [Timeout]    0.1 sec\n    Keyword\n```\n```python\nfrom robot.api import logger\n\nMSG = 'A rather long message that is slow to write on the disk. ' * 10000\n\ndef keyword():\n    while True:\n        logger.info(MSG)\n```\n\nUnfortunately the current mechanism doesn't prevent the problem if a library keyword uses `BuiltIn.run_keyword` for executing other keywords that log messages. For example, this variation corrupts the output file nearly every time I run it on Windows:\n\n```python\nfrom robot.api import logger\nfrom robot.libraries.BuiltIn import BuiltIn\n\nMSG = 'A rather long message that is slow to write on the disk. ' * 10000\n\ndef keyword():\n    while True:\n        BuiltIn().run_keyword('Log Huge Message')\n\ndef log_huge_message():\n    logger.info(MSG)\n```\n\nI haven't been able to get the above example, or any variation of, to fail on Linux. This is most likely due to the platform specific timeout implementation, but looking at the related code, it seems the problem _could_ happen anywhere. Anyway, this is a serious issue even if it would occur only on Windows.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5417/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5417/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5416","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5416/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5416/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5416/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5416","id":3023303881,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ860M_TJ","number":5416,"title":"Deprecate

`is_bytes`, `is_number` and `is_integer` are part of the Python 2/3 compatibility layer we have mostly deprecated already some time ago (#4150) and `is_pathlike` was added for consistency for these other `is_xxx` methods. All of them are just wrappers around `isinstance` with these implementations:\n\n```python\nfrom os import PathLike  # pathlib.Path would typically work as well\n\n\ndef is_integer(item):\n    return isinstance(item, int)\n\ndef is_number(item):\n    return isinstance(item, (int, float))\n\ndef is_bytes(item):\n    return isinstance(item, (bytes, bytearray))\n\ndef is_string(item):\n    return isinstance(item, str)\n\ndef is_pathlike(item):\n    return isinstance(item, PathLike)\n```\n\nUtilities like this are kind of handy, but they also make the code harder to understand for people who aren't familiar with these utils compared to using standard `isinstance`. Perhaps more importantly, type checkers (and IDEs using them) cannot use these utils for \"type narrowing\" and thus report false positives. Finally, extra imports add some noise and extra function calls have a tiny performance penalty. All in all, I believe it's better to use `isinstance` and we should deprecate these utils and remove them later.\n\nWe can use the same deprecation approach we've used with the Python 2/3 compatibility utils (#4150). Those utils are deprecated so that there's currently a deprecation warning that's not visible by default, the warning will be changed to a more visible warning in RF 8.0 and the plan is to remove the utils in RF 9.0. I believe that's a good timeline also for these utils, but we can delay removal if needed.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5416/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5416/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5415","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5415/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5415/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5415/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5415","id":3023183644,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ860Mh8c","number":5415,"title":"Deprecate

Deprecation is easy, because we can use the same deprecation mechanism we've used for deprecating the old Python 2/3 compatibility layer (#4150). The compatibility utils are deprecated so that there's currently a deprecation warning that's not visible by default, it will be changed to a more visible warning in RF 8.0 and the plan is to remove the utils in RF 9.0.

Version info\n* Robot Framework 7.2.2 (Python 3.11.11 on darwin)\n* OS: macOS 15.3.2\n\n### Steps to reproduce\n1. Run the following robot test, (e.g. `robot a.robot`)\n    ```\n    *** Test Cases ***\n    Test\n        ${a}=    Create List    v1    v2\n        @{b}=    Create List    w1    w2\n        &{c}=    Create Dictionary\n        ${c.d}=    Set Variable    x\n        ${c.e}=    Create List    y1    y2\n        @{c.f}=    Create List    z1    z2\n        Log    a=${{repr($a)}}    WARN\n        Log    b=${{repr($b)}}    WARN\n        Log    c=${{repr($c)}}    WARN\n    ```\n2. See the following warning messages\n    ```\n    a=['v1', 'v2']\n    b=['w1', 'w2']\n    c={'d': 'x', 'e': ['y1', 'y2']}\n    ```\n\nExpected behavior: see\n```\na=['v1', 'v2']\nb=['w1', 'w2']\nc={'d': 'x', 'e': ['y1', 'y2'], 'f': ['z1', 'z2']}\n```\n\nExplanation: According to [Create List](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/libraries/BuiltIn.html#Create%20List)'s documentation, its result can be assigned to either `${scalar}` or `@{list}` variables. It also works well when assigning to `${c.e}` (`c` is a dictionary). However, it does not work when assigning to `@{c.f}`. Also, there are no error messages about the failed assignment.\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5405/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5405/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5404","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5404/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5404/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5404/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5404","id":3001620687,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86y6RjP","number":5404,"title":"Time

with embedded arguments utilizing custom regexps can be used with variables, but only if the variable is used on its own. If there are multiple variables or a variable and some other content, usage fails. These examples demonstrate the issue:\n\n```robotframework\n*** Variables ***\n${HI}       hi\n${H}        h\n\n*** Test Cases ***\nPasses\n    Robot says \"hi\"!\n    Robot says \"${HI}\"!\n\nMultiple variables fails\n    Robot says \"${HI}${EMPTY}\"!\n\nVariable with other content fails\n    Robot says \"${H}i\"!\n\n*** Keywords ***\nRobot says \"${greeting:hi}\"!\n    Should Be Equal    ${greeting}    hi\n```\n\nThe reason for the failure is that the custom pattern `hi` doesn't match `${HI}${EMPTY}` or `${H}i`. It obviously doesn't match `${HI}` either, but the custom regexp handling code automatically handles variables used on their own. That logic has a bug that it doesn't work with the inline evaluation syntax (#5394) and the root cause for that bug is the same that causes this issue.\n\nThe inline evaluation issue (#5394) can be fixed like this:\n\n- Replace variables in the calling keyword with a placeholder before matching the regexp.\n- Keep a mapping between placeholders and original variables.\n- Append the custom regexp with a pattern matching the placeholder.\n- Replace placeholders with original variables after the regexp match.\n\nUnfortunately the above doesn't fix this issue, because the extra content in addition to the single variable means that pattern appended in the second last step doesn't match the whole value. Because I don't see any simple ways to fix this, and because nobody has reported this issue earlier, I believe it is enough to document this limitation. If it turns out to create concrete problems, we can return to this later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5396/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5396/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5395","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5395/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5395/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5395/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5395","id":2969342700,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86w_JLs","number":5395,"title":"Messages

use.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73456db5-50d4-4365-8928-338b6f73615b)\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d88cf07b-1311-41ee-b631-935013fac264)\n\nSee the Reproduction.zip to do reproduce.\n\n[Reproduction.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19586581/Reproduction.zip)\n\nafaik if a timeout is active, the actual keyword call is in a thread and therefore it does not effect the log_level?","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5395/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5395/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5394","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5394/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5394/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5394/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5394","id":2969289399,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86w-8K3","number":5394,"title":"Embedded

variables work, but using the `${{expr}}` syntax doesn't. These examples demonstrate the problem:\n\n```robotframework\n*** Variables ***\n${HI}       hi\n\n*** Test Cases ***\nPasses\n    Robot says \"hi\"!\n    Robot says \"${HI}\"!\n\nFails\n    Robot says \"${{'hi'}}\"!\n\n*** Keywords ***\nRobot says \"${greeting:hi}\"!\n    Should Be Equal    ${greeting}    hi\n```\n\nThis problem is due to the custom regexp `hi` not matching the Python inline evaluation syntax `${{'hi'}}`. It obviously doesn't match the normal variable `${HI}` either, but the code handling custom regexps appends a pattern `r'|\\$\\{[^\\}]+\\}'` to the custom regexp and that matches normal variables. It doesn't match the inline evaluation syntax because the match ends for the first closing `}`. The right behavior would be ending the match when there's a balanced number of opening `{`s and closing `}`s, but I doubt regexp can do that.\n\nI noticed this issue when investigating another embedded arguments related issues (#5330). That issue can be fixed by replacing variables with a placeholder before matching the keyword and replacing placeholders with original variables after the match. Incidentally that fix helps fixing also this issue. The only additional thing to do is changing the custom regexp handling code so the current pattern that tries to match variables is changed to a pattern that matches the used placeholders.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5394/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5394/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5393","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5393/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5393/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5393/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5393","id":2968614286,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86w8XWO","number":5393,"title":"Cannot

should take automatic code formatting into use. I don't personally need it that much, but it would certainly make it easier for contributors to format their code and that saves my time in reviewing PRs.\n\nI've experimented with Black already years ago, but back then it did some changes that I really disliked and that caused huge amount of noise in history. The situation is nowadays better in that regard, and the amount of unnecessary (in my opinion) and annoying (again, my opinion) changes is pretty small. The Ruff formatter is also so fast that formatting is instantaneous even with our relatively big project. Overall, auto-formatting benefits are nowadays bigger than problems even in my opinion.\n\nAdding auto-formatting to an existing projects basically has two parts:\n- Format the code, adapt it if needed, and commit it.\n- Automate formatting and/or linting so that it happens on CI and with PRs.\n\nThis issue concentrates fully on the first part. My plan is basically this:\n- Create a simple `ruff.toml` and commit it to the project root.\n- Run `ruff format`.\n- Go through the changes and adapt formatting where needed. This is quite a big task, but needs to be done only once.\n- Commit formatting changes as a single commit.\n- Create [--ignore-revs-file](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-blame#Documentation/git-blame.txt---ignore-revs-fileltfilegt) with the above commit and [configure GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/viewing-and-understanding-files#ignore-commits-in-the-blame-view) to use it.\n- Instruct in contribution guidelines that contributors should run `ruff format` before creating a PR.\n\nFurther automation can then be done later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5387/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5387/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5386","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5386/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5386/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5386/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5386","id":2947855542,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86vtLS2","number":5386,"title":"Dialogs:

are planning to enhance the look and feel of the Dialogs library (#5334) and enhancement is adding custom application and taskbar icons. We'll naturally use the Robot Framework logo and to be able to use with with Dialogs, we need to bundle it with the distribution somehow. Instead of hiding it somewhere, we could make it available in a stable place to make it available also for external tools such as custom installers.\n\nMy proposal is that we add a single PNG image (`logo.png`) with size 256x256 directly inside the `robot` root package. The reason for this proposal is:\n- PNG is a pretty universally accepted icon format.\n- 256x256 is the biggest icon size used on Windows and I doubt other OSes use bigger ones either. Apps typically can scale images and when scaling down, results are pretty good.\n- Having icons for each used size would give better results, but at least with Dialogs the amount of OSes and windows managers that we support is so big that trying to handle them all is too much work. Having a load of icons bundled with Robot doesn't sound like a good idea for maintenance point of view and it would also increase the distribution size considerably.\n- We could consider a separate `robot/assets` folder for icons and other such assets, but I believe having just one icon should be enough and having that prominently in the root sounds good to me. It also make accessing the icon easier.\n\nI believe just having the icon under the `robot` package is enough and we don't need any dedicated API to access it. The reason is that accessing this kind of package data using [importlib.resources](https://docs.python.org/3/library/importlib.resources.html) is very easy:\n```python\nfrom importlib.resources import files, read_binary\n\n# Get a Path-like object\npath = files('robot').joinpath('logo.png')\n\n# Read data directly\ndata = read_binary('robot', 'logo.png')\n```\nAlthough no API is needed, this needs to be documented in the User

#5376 proposes enhancing the Process library so that if Robot's timeout occurs when a process is waited to end, the process is killed instead of leaving it running on the background. That turned out to be surprisingly simple. Because other libraries may have similar needs, we should document how to do that in the User Guide. In addition to that, we should make sure that the related APIs are good.\n\nWhen Robot's timeout occurs, `robot.errors.TimeoutError` is raised in the library code. It can basically occur at any point similarly as the standard `KeyboardInterrupt` or `SystemExit`. The simplest way to do cleanup activities if any exception occurs is using `try/finally`. It is really simple and straightforward, and it also has a benefit that the exception is automatically re-raised:\n\n```python\ndef keyword():\n    try:\n        do_something()\n    finally:\n        do_cleanup()\n```\n\nIn some cases there may be a need to catch Robot's `TimeoutError` explicitly. That's easy as well, but then the exception should be re-raised explicitly:\n\n```python\nfrom robot.errors import TimeoutError\n\ndef keyword():\n    try:\n        do_something()\n    except TimeoutError:\n        do_cleanup()\n        raise\n```\n\nA problem with the above is that Python also has its own [TimeoutError](https://docs.python.org/3/library/exceptions.html#TimeoutError). This is problematic because `TimeoutError` shadows the standard exception and also because you don't know which exception `except TimeoutError:` refers to when you see just that line. Now that we are planning to make our `TimeoutError` part of the public API, I believe we should rename it to avoid confusion. I think `TimeoutExceeded` would be fine, it's different to `subprocess.TimeoutExpired`, but I'm open for other ideas as well. To avoid backwards compatibility problems, we should preserve the old name as an alias at least until RF 9.\n\nIf you wonder why we added `TimeoutError` in the first place when Python also has `TimeoutError`, the reason is that ours was there first. It existed already in RF 2.0, the first open source version, in 2008, but Python got its `TimeoutError` only in Python 3.3 in 2012.

#5345 reported that Robot's timeouts weren't able to stop `Run Process` or `Wait For Process` keywords. That was fixed so that these keywords can be stopped, but processes that keywords were waiting for were left running. Leaving process on background especially is likely not a good idea, especially because they often have hung in this case. This issue proposes killing the processes instead.\n\nKilling processes if Robot's timeout occur requires handling the timeout in the library code. That is actually surprisingly easy by catching `robot.errors.TimeoutError` and re-raising it once the process has been killed. There could be other libraries that want to do such cleanup as well, and documenting how to do that in the User Guide is probably a good idea. I'll submit a separate issue about that.\n\nNotice that killing process as proposed above doesn't fully prevent processes to be left running. That can still happen if you use `Start Process` and Robot's timeout occurs before `Wait For Process` is called. We could enhance the library by adding some kind of auto-closing functionality to it, but I don't consider that too high priority because the library already has `Terminate All Processes` that can be used in test or suite teardown. Such an enhancement should anyway get its own issue.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5376/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5376/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5368","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5368/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5368/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5368/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/5368","id":2920313961,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ86uEHRp","number":5368,"title":"Library

using the `[Teardown]` setting with a keyword that accepts a list as an embedded argument, the variable is passed as a string rather than as a list. This behavior causes list-related keywords (such as` Log List`) to fail with a `TypeError`, even though the same keyword works correctly when called directly or using `Run Keyword`.\n\n**Code to Reproduce:**\n\n```robotframework\n*** Settings ***\nLibrary     Collections\n\n*** Variables ***\n@{my_list}      test_value    test_value2\n\n*** Test Cases ***\nTeardown Situation 1    # This works fine\n    Log To Console    \\n    # Keyword to avoid empty test error\n    Keyword With Embbed Arguments \"${my_list}\"\n\nTeardown Situation 2    # This fails\n    Log To Console    \\n    \n    [Teardown]    Keyword With Embbed Arguments \"${my_list}\"\n\nTeardown Situation 3    # This fails\n    Log To Console    \\n\n    [Teardown]    Keyword With Embbed Arguments \"@{my_list}\"\n\nTeardown Situation 4    # This works\n    Log To Console    \\n\n    [Teardown]    Run Keyword    Keyword With Embbed Arguments \"${my_list}\"\n\nTeardown Situation 5    # This works\n    Log To Console    \\n\n    [Teardown]    Run Keyword    Keyword With Embbed Arguments \"@{my_list}\"\n\n*** Keywords ***\nKeyword With Embbed Arguments \"${argument}\"\n    Log To Console    ${argument}\n\n    # Verifying the type of the received variable\n    ${result}=    Evaluate    type(${argument})\n    Log To Console    ${result}\n    \n    # Every list-related keyword generates an error:\n    # TypeError: Expected argument 1 to be a list or list-like, got string instead.\n    Log List    ${argument}\n\n```\n\n**Expected Behavior:**\nWhen a list variable (either `${my_list}` or `@{my_list}`) is passed via `[Teardown]` with embedded arguments, it should retain its list type and work seamlessly with list-related keywords.\n\n**Actual Behavior:**\nIn the failing cases, the list variable is interpreted as a string, leading to errors in keywords (e.g., `Log List`) that expect a list.\n\n**Additional Information:**\n- Workaround: Using `Run Keyword` in the teardown (as shown in Teardown Situations 4 and 5) avoids the issue.\n- Environment: Windows 10 Pro 22H2, Python 3.10.11, Robot-Framework
