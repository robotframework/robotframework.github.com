Depending on the keyboard layout, writing them can also require annoying finger acrobatics. It would thus be convenient if it would be possible to use `$var` instead of `${var}` and also `@list`, `&dict` and `%env` instead of `@{list}`, `&{dict}` and `%{env}`. For example, all these could be supported:\r\n\r\n```\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n$VARIABLE        value\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Log    $VARIABLE\r\n    $var =    Keyword\r\n    FOR    $item    IN    @stuff\r\n        Log    $item\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn all the above cases the `$var` syntax is used on its own and that would work fine. This syntax wouldn't work too well when embedded to a string, though. For example, if you have variables `$name` and `$named`, string `Hello, $name!` could be parsed like `Hello, ${name}!`, but `abc$named` could be either `abc${name}d` or `abc${named}`. We could require using the `${var}` syntax in cases where `$var` is ambiguous, that's how [shell scripts](https://learn-bash.org/variables.html) work, but I believe it's better to require it always when variables are embedded. That makes the syntax more consistent and this approach is also considerably easier to implement. We can, however, look at this again later if the `$var` syntax is universally considered better and using it always (when possible) is considered important.\r\n\r\nSupporting the `$var` syntax would be a backwards incompatible change, but if we support it only when variables are used on their own, it shouldn't be that bad. It would mean that all arguments starting with `$`, `@`, `&` and `%` would need to be escaped like `\\$not_var`. We already require this with `#` (which otherwise starts a comment) so there's precedence for such syntax. Nevertheless, this would break lot of tests/tasks and the change can be made only in a major version. It would also be a good idea to deprecate using arguments starting with these characters already earlier. If this enhancement is considered important, it could be added in RF 7.0 and deprecation added in RF 6.2 or possibly already in RF 6.1.\r\n\r\nAlthough the basic syntax would be simple, there are some design decision to be made:\r\n\r\n1. Should we limit variable base name to only alpha numeric characters and underscore? In other words, should something like `$! als lkjas` be considered a variable with base name `! als lkjat` or should the whole thing be considered a literal string? Being more strict with the variable name would mean there's less need for escaping, but then these variables would work inconsistently compared to \"normal\" variables. It would also mean that some built-in variables like `${/}` couldn't be used like `$/`. I got a feeling that it's better if we don't limit the name. \r\n2. Should this syntax support item access like `$list[0]` and `$dict[key][nested]`? I believe it should.\r\n3. Should this syntax support \"extended variable syntax\" like `$var.upper()` and `$SPACE * 10`? I don't have too strong opinion on this, but I guess it would be better to support it. Needing to use `${var.upper()}` in this case would be a bit strange and inconsistent.\r\n\r\nI'll add this issue tentatively to RF 7.0 scope, but we still need to make a bit more official decision about it. If we decide to include it, then another issue should be submitted about deprecating arguments starting with `$` and other such variable meta characters.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/reactions","total_count":7,"+1":4,"-1":2,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":1},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4674/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4667","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4667/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4667/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4667/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4667","id":1603524059,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85fk9Xb","number":4667,"title":"Remove deprecated constructs from Libdoc spec files","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":113657783,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTM2NTc3ODM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/backwards%20incompatible","name":"backwards incompatible","color":"fbca04","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/64","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/64","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/64/labels","id":7828494,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Ad3QO","number":64,"title":"v7.0","description":"Next major release with still open scope and timeline.","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":20,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2022-04-01T12:32:38Z","updated_at":"2023-03-14T13:42:47Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-02-28T17:46:39Z","updated_at":"2023-02-28T17:46:39Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"`datatypes` were deprecated in favor of more generic `typedocs` in RF 5.0 (#4160) and in RF 6.1 there were argument type related changes (#4538).

To help with that, various libraries have keywords that avoid logging given values even though their keywords normally do that. For example, SeleniumLibrary has `Input Password` that doesn't log the password and also temporarily disables Robot's logging to avoid the password being logged by the underlying Selenium on DEBUG level. This works fine otherwise, but if tests are run with `--loglevel TRACE`, Robot anyway logs all argument values and the password will be visible. Browser's `Fill Secret` tries to avoid that problem by requiring the value to be passed using a special `$var` syntax so that Robot won't log the actual variable value. Unfortunately that doesn't work if the value is passed to `Fill Secret` via a user keyword and only that keyword uses the `$var` syntax like in the following example:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${PASSWORD}        secret\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Keyword    ${PASSWORD}    # This value is logged on TRACE level\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nKeyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${pwd}\r\n    Fill Secret    selector    $pwd\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo make it easier to use values that should not be logged, I propose we add new variable syntax `*{var}` to create \"secret variables\". The syntax could be used when creating variables in the Variables section, when creating local variables based on keyword return values, and with `Set Global/Suite/Test/Local Variable` keywords. The syntax would be only used for creating variables, they would be used normally like `${var}`:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n*{PASSWORD}        secret\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Keyword    ${PASSWORD}\r\n    *{local} =    Another keyword\r\n    Keyword    ${local}\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nKeyword\r\n    [Arguments]    ${pwd}\r\n    Fill Secret    selector    ${pwd}\r\n```\r\n\r\nTechnically the `*{var}` assignment would create a custom object with this kind of implementation:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Secret:\r\n    def __init__(self, value, name=None):\r\n        self.value = value\r\n        self.name = name\r\n    def __str__(self):\r\n        return f'<Secret {self.name}>' if self.name else '<Secret>'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese objects would be used when the variable is passed from tests to user keywords and from user keywords to other user keywords. The real value would, however, be passed to library keywords so they would get values normally and wouldn't need to be changed to benefit from this new syntax.\r\n\r\nAlthough this new syntax would work with existing keywords, we should make it possible for library keywords to require arguments to be \"secret\". That's basically what `Fill Secret` does but this new syntax would avoid the problem that the value can be logged on higher level. A convenient way to support this would be type hints:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom robot.api.secrets import Secret\r\n\r\ndef example(secret: Secret):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis would work so that Robot would validate that the used value is a `Secret` and fail if it's not. I believe we should pass the real value, not the actual `Secret` object, to the underlying keyword also in this case. That can confuse type checkers but keywords can use [typing.cast](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.cast) if that's a problem. To support normal type conversion, we should also allow parameterizing the type hint like `Secret[int]`.\r\n\r\nKeywords could also return secret values simply by returning `Secret` instances:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom robot.api.secrets import Secret\r\n\r\ndef example():\r\n    return Secret('value')\r\n```\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4537/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4501","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4501/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4501/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4501/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4501","id":1401918600,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85Tj5SI","number":4501,"title":"Loundly deprecate old Python 2/3 compatibility layer and other deprecated utils","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":121827221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjE4MjcyMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/deprecation","name":"deprecation","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/64","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/64","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/64/labels","id":7828494,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Ad3QO","number":64,"title":"v7.0","description":"Next major release with still open scope and timeline.","creator":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":20,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2022-04-01T12:32:38Z","updated_at":"2023-03-14T13:42:47Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2022-10-08T11:36:44Z","updated_at":"2022-10-08T11:36:44Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"We \"quietly\" deprecated Python 2/3 compatibility layer in RF 5.0 (#4150) and `TRUE/FALSE_STRINGS` in RF 6.0 (#4500).

Using them fails with a message telling that the keyword name is reserved and some keywords also instruct how to use the actual `FOR`, `IF`, etc. syntax.\r\n\r\nWe added the library ages ago to avoid problems if new syntax is added. Now all the syntax there (and more!) has been added so there's no need to reserve anything. When we added `IF` in RF 4.0, we also made a decision to require all this kind of syntax to be upper case. That makes it mostly unnecessary to reserve possible new syntax because even if we'd add something like `CASE`, there would be no problem using keyword `Case`.\r\n\r\nWhen this library is removed, using a keyword like `Continue` will continue to fail, but the error message changes from `'Continue' is a reserved keyword.` to `No keyword with name 'Continue' found.`. With keywords containing usage instructions, like `If` that currently fails like `'If' is a reserved keyword. It must be an upper case 'IF' when used as a marker.`, the new error isn't as informative as earlier. I would say we can nowadays expect users to know that this kind of syntax must be upper case so this isn't a big deal. If we were to report such errors to users, we should detect them already at parsing time anyway to make errors easily available for IDEs and other tools using Robot's parsing modules.\r\n\r\nA benefit of removing the Reserved library is that in some contexts the current custom error message is pretty confusing.

currently have our own `get_timestamp` function for getting the current timestamp and `get_elapsed_time` for calculating the difference between two timestamps as milliseconds.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> t1 = get_timestamp()\r\n>>> t2 = get_timestamp()\r\n>>> print(t1)\r\n20220308 12:37:43.875\r\n>>> print(t2)\r\n20220308 12:37:49.022\r\n>>> get_elapsed_time(t1, t2)\r\n5147\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe should replace these custom functions with functionality provided by Python's standard [datetime](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) module. In practice we could get the current time by using `datetime.now()` and could calculate the elapsed time by simply subtracting `datetime` objects:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> d1 = datetime.now()\r\n>>> d2 = datetime.now()\r\n>>> print(d1)\r\n2022-03-08 12:43:56.109349\r\n>>> print(d2)\r\n2022-03-08 12:44:03.567573\r\n>>> delta = d2 - d1\r\n>>> round(delta.total_seconds() * 1000)\r\n7458\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne benefit of using the standard `datetime` module would be that we could remove lot of our custom code. A bigger benefit is performance measured here using [timeit](https://docs.python.org/3/library/timeit.html):\r\n```python\r\n>>> timeit(lambda: get_timestamp())\r\n1.0487582740024664\r\n>>> timeit(lambda: datetime.now())\r\n0.2848877740034368\r\n>>> timeit(lambda: get_elapsed_time(t1, t2))\r\n5.105318886999157\r\n>>> timeit(lambda: round((d2-d1).total_seconds() * 1000))\r\n0.24636966099205893\r\n```\r\nAs can seen from the examples, the difference in performance is pretty big when getting the timestamp and rather huge when calculating the elapsed time. These tests each run one million iterations, so the time for one iteration isn't huge and this doesn't matter much with smallish test/task runs. With bigger runs containing e.g. loops times start to add, though, because we call `get_timestamp` twice and `get_elapsed_time` once for each keyword, loop iteration, IF/ELSE branch, and so on.

currently start processes using `stdin=subprocess.PIPE` by default. That typically works fine, but issue #4065 demonstrates it can cause problems with some processes. It would be better to use `stdin=None` by default. It would avoid problems like in #4065 and be the same as the default behavior of the underlying [subprocess.Popen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen).\r\n\r\nThe problem with this change is that it can cause backwards compatibility problems. In most cases there's no difference, but in some case being able to write to the stdin of the started process can be handy.

That has worked very well, and it would be nice if something like that would work also with variables defined in test data. We probably could re-use the underlying argument conversion logic which ought to make it relatively easy to implement this. We also got a similar request related to variables passed from the command line #2946.\r\n\r\nAutomatically converting numbers like `42` and `3.14` to actual integers/floats would be handy, even when we already support them as variables like `${42}` and `${3.14}`. Being able to use datatime objects, bytes, and other types supported by the argument conversion that don't have direct variable alternatives would naturally be even more useful (but also less commonly needed). I would expect this to be most useful with lists and dictionaries and especially with nested list and dicts that cannot easily be constructed in Robot's data.\r\n\r\nMy proposed syntax for this functionality is supporting \"type postfix\" like `:int` in variable names like this:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n${COUNT:int}         42\r\n${GOOD IDEA:bool}    Yes    # Converted to Boolean True\r\n${ANIMALS:list}      ['cat', 'dog', 'horse']    # Python syntax\r\n${NESTED:dict}       {'a': 1, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}    # Great with JSON\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis syntax is derived from Python's function annotation syntax and also the same syntax that was decided to be used with command line variables in #2946. Variable names would naturally be created without the type prefix like `${COUNT}` and `${GOOD IDEA}`.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being available in the variable section, the new syntax should also be available also when creating variable otherwise, including in keyword arguments:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Keywords ***\r\nExample\r\n    [Arguments]    ${count:int}\r\n    ${nested:dict} =    Set Variable    {'a': ${count}, 'b': [{'x': 2}, {'x': 3}]}\r\n    Set Test Variable    ${DATE:datetime}     2019-08-23 12:03:42\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are some design decision still to be made like should `${X:dict}` create a `DotDict` instance that allows `${X.key}` syntax and how to handle possible backwards incompatibility issues. For most parts the design looks pretty good, though, and I think this would be a valuable addition to Robot Framework. If there's enough interest, we can consider adding this already to RF 3.2 scope.

execution just some tests from a big directory structure, parsing only relevant files instead of the whole structure makes parsing faster. We don't currently have any explicit option for limiting parsing like that, but when the `--suite` option is used files not matching the specified suite are ignored. This functionality won't work too well in the future, though, if we make it possible to change the suite name using the `Name` setting (#4583). It's also likely that not too many users know about this functionality and the underlying logic to convert file and directory names to suite names for matching purposes is also rather complicated.\r\n\r\nA good way to solve all the above problems is adding a separate command line option or options for controlling what files to parse. Once we have such functionality, we can remove the current performance optimization from `--suite`, a separate option makes the feature easier to discover, and also the code gets simpler. There are some design decisions to be made, though:\r\n\r\n- What should the option be named? I was thinking `--includefiles`, but it has the same prefix as `--include` which would mean that shortened usages like `--incl` that used to be unique wouldn't work anymore. Perhaps `--parsefiles` or just `--files` would be better.\r\n- Should the value be a literal value or should we accept glob patterns? I believe supporting patterns is a good idea.\r\n- Should the value be just a file name or a relative or absolute path to it? I see benefits with both so possibly we could support both usages.\r\n- Should the value include file extension? I believe it should be allowed but preferably not required. If that gets too complicated, always requiring it is probably better.\r\n- Should there be separate option for excluding files? It would make some use cases easier, but I'm not sure is that worth the added complexity.\r\n- Should this option affect only files or also directories? If the option would match a directory, we could automatically include all files under it, recursively. On the other hand, just matching files would be easier to implement and explain.\r\n- Should we have separate options for matching files and directories? That's probably too much, especially if we'd have separate options for including and excluding. If directories are considered important, probably better to implement this so that the same option work with both files and directories.\r\n\r\nThis feature should be implemented before RF 7 where we'd like to change `--suite` so that it doesn't affect parsing. That would give users who need the performance optimization time to update their scripts.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4687/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4687/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4685","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4685/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4685/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4685/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4685","id":1622467797,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85gtOTV","number":4685,"title":"Deprecate `SHORTEST` mode being default with `FOR IN ZIP` loops","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":121827221,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMjE4MjcyMjE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/deprecation","name":"deprecation","color":"fef2c0","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972220183,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4PFw","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20small","name":"effort: small","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/68","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/68","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/68/labels","id":8815657,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84AhoQp","number":68,"title":"v6.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"yanne","id":159146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne","html_url":"https://github.com/yanne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":16,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-01-03T09:29:35Z","updated_at":"2023-03-14T13:34:52Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2023-03-13T23:41:06Z","updated_at":"2023-03-13T23:42:05Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"RF 6.1 made it possible to configure what to do if lengths of lists iterated using `FOR IN ZIP` are different (#4682).

If lengths don't match, there should be a deprecation warning instead of a failure, though.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4685/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4685/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4546","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4546/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4546/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4546/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4546","id":1464178432,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85XRZcA","number":4546,"title":"Support item assigment with lists and dicts like `${x}[key] =    Keyword`","user":{"login":"pekkaklarck","id":114985,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjExNDk4NQ==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/114985?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck","html_url":"https://github.com/pekkaklarck","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/pekkaklarck/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430354,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNTQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20high","name":"priority: high","color":"006d2c","default":false,"description":""},{"id":4972223712,"node_id":"LA_kwDOAUSaQ88AAAABKF4c4A","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/effort:%20medium","name":"effort: medium","color":"5319E7","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"open","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/68","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/68","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/68/labels","id":8815657,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84AhoQp","number":68,"title":"v6.2","description":"","creator":{"login":"yanne","id":159146,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE1OTE0Ng==","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/159146?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne","html_url":"https://github.com/yanne","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/yanne/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":16,"closed_issues":0,"state":"open","created_at":"2023-01-03T09:29:35Z","updated_at":"2023-03-14T13:34:52Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"comments":0,"created_at":"2022-11-25T08:11:16Z","updated_at":"2023-01-16T08:49:46Z","closed_at":null,"author_association":"MEMBER","active_lock_reason":null,"body":"These aren't currently supported:\r\n```\r\n${dict} =    Create Dictionary    key=initial\r\n${dict}[key] =    Set Variable    new\r\n\r\n${list} =    Create List    one    two\r\n${list}[0] =    Set Variable    new\r\n```\r\nEspecially setting dictionary items would be useful, but there certainly are cases where setting list items is convenient as well.

automatic argument conversion (#2890) makes it possible to have a keywords like\r\n```python\r\ndef accept_list(arg: list):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\ndef accept_dict(arg: dict):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nand call them so that argument are Python literals\r\n```\r\nAccept List    ['list', 'items', 'here']\r\nAccept Dict    {'key': 'value', 'another': 'item'}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is pretty convenient, but needing to use Python syntax is a bit ugly in general and especially annoying when using embedded arguments that are supposed to enhance readability:\r\n```\r\nSelect animals ['cat', 'dog'] from list\r\n```\r\n\r\nI propose we enhance argument conversion so that we support also the following syntax:\r\n```\r\nAccept List    list, items, here\r\nAccept Dict    key=value, another=item\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe high level semantics would be as follows:\r\n\r\n- Separator between items is a comma _and_ a space. This allows using commas in values like `first, second,with,commas, third`. Having a comma followed by a space in the value wouldn't be possible.\r\n- We could allow using a semicolon and a space as an alternative separator. In that case we'd use the separator that's encountered first. This would allow usages like `first; second, with, commas followed by spaces; third`.\r\n- With dictionaries the separator between key and value is `=`. This is the syntax we use also when creating `&{dict}` variables.\r\n- Values are considered strings by default. This can be changed by using generics (#4433) and `TypedDict` (#4477).\r\n- Because this would be handled by type convertors, variables would have been resolved already earlier. That means that something like `${1}, ${2}` wouldn't create a list of integers. See the above point for alternatives.\r\n- Also escapes are handled before type conversion. That makes it impossible to use something like `first, second\\,with\\,commas` for escaping commas in values.\r\n\r\nThis enhancement would ease using collections a lot especially if #4433 and #4477 are implemented. If we agree above semantics are fine, implementation would also be pretty easy.

The whole system to set tags for tests with `Force Tags`, `Default Tags` and `[Tags]` is somewhat complicated and issue #4365 proposes simplifying it so that `Force Tags` is renamed to `Test Tags` and `Default Tags` is removed altogether. I believe simplifying the syntax is a good idea, but I understand there are still sometimes cases where specifying tags that most tests have but some don't would be convenient.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that we'd make it possible to use `-tag` syntax with tests that want to opt out from tags set globally.

For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing('example')\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords. It is possible to use `BuiltIn.run_keyword` to execute other keywords so that they are shown as child keywords and #4237 discusses better APIs for that usage.\r\n\r\nA problem with using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` is that keywords executed with it must be available as normal keywords either in the library running other keywords or in some other imported library. That's ok if keywords are usable on their own, but it is possible that child keywords cannot be used like that. This problem can be avoided by making it possible to run any callable as the [final proposal](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237#issuecomment-1058077142) in #4237 suggests. There could, however, be even better solutions for the underlying need.\r\n\r\nA solution I have been thinking is is using a context manager that would create a keyword in log (and in output.xml). We probably could use our existing `robot.running.Keyword` for that purpose. The usage could be something like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    with Keyword('Do first thing', args=['example'], doc='Example'):\r\n        do_first_thing()\r\n    with Keyword('Do second thing'):\r\n        print('No need to call a method, implementation can be directly inside the context manager!')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese are the main benefits of this approach compared to `BuitlIn.run_keyword` would be:\r\n1. No need to expose child keywords as real keywords.\r\n2. No need to even make each child keyword a callable. Implementation could be directly inside the context manager.\r\n3.

One good example is SeleniumLibrary, that makes it possible to register a keyword that will be executed if any of its own keywords fails. Sometimes, especially when doing task automation, it is also beneficial to log actions done by the keyword in the log file separately. For example,\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef do_something():\r\n    do_first_thing()\r\n    do_second_thing()\r\n```\r\nwill in the log file be shown as a single keyword without any child keywords, but there are sometimes needs to show `do_first_thing` and `do_second_thing` as child keywords.\r\n\r\nNowadays keywords can execute other keywords by using `BuiltIn.run_keyword`. It works but has several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Arguments are resolved twice. This  means replacing variables and handling syntax like `\\n`. For example, if we have a keyword like\r\n    ```python\r\n    def example(arg):\r\n        BuiltIn().run_keyword('Log To Console', arg)\r\n    ```\r\n    and call it like\r\n    ```\r\n    Example    c:\\\\temp\r\n    ```\r\n    the actually logged string has a tab character. The reason is that `\\\\t` is first resolved to string `\\t` which is then on the second round resolved to a tab.\r\n\r\n    Double resolving can be avoided be registering the keyword to be a \"run keyword variant\", but that API isn't really public and it's also pretty bad in general. We have #2190 about enhancing it and making it public, but it would probably be better to avoid this double resolving altogether.\r\n\r\n2. Related to above, the keyword using `BuiltIn.run_keyword` cannot safely call it without escaping strings. For example, something like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Log To Console', 'c:\\\\temp')` won't work correctly and the argument should be `c:\\\\\\\\temp` instead.\r\n\r\n3. `BuiltIn.run_keyword` only accepts positional arguments. For example, if we had a keyword implemented like\r\n    ```pyhton\r\n    def example(upper=False):\r\n        ...\r\n    ```\r\n    we couldn't call it like `BuiltIn.run_keyword('Example', upper=True)` but instead needed to use `BuiltIn.run_keywod('Example', 'upper=True')`.\r\n\r\nThe above examples ought to make it clear that a better API is needed. I have some ideas how to API could look and will write separate comments about that a bit later.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/reactions","total_count":1,"+1":1,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4237/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":null,"score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3761","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3761/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3761/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3761/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3761","id":743242487,"node_id":"MDU6SXNzdWU3NDMyNDI0ODc=","number":3761,"title":"Native

added support for the optional start index in RF 4.0 (#3781). It was implemented so that only the runner object detected that the last iterated value has `start=` prefix and the parser doesn't know anything about it. When similar configuration was added to `WHILE` (`limit`) and `EXCEPT` (`type`), they were already recognized by the parser making the behavior with `start` inconsistent. This should be changed and `start` with `FOR IN ENUMERATE` loops handled by the parser as well.\r\n\r\nHandling `start` in the parser means that the `For` model object in the `TestSuite` structure needs `start` attribute as well. The same `For` is used with all `FOR` loop types and it getting an attribute that only affects one of them is a bit questionable, but I don't consider it too big a problem. We could consider adding separate `ForInEnumerate`, `ForInRange` and `ForInZip` model object, but I consider that too much work compared to benefits at least right now. We also need to add `start` as an attribute to `output.xml`. Changing it always has backwards incompatibility concerns, but tools processing XML files shouldn't be bothered by new attributes so I consider this safe.\r\n\r\nOne reason to do this is that we plan to make `FOR IN ZIP` configurable as well. It's configuration options should definitely be handled by the parser and in that case `FOR IN ENUMERATE` behaving differently would be really weird.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4684/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4684/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683","id":1621271832,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85goqUY","number":4683,"title":"Report

when you have an invalid setting like `[Setpu]` in a test (or keyword, or task), error is reported on the console, but the test is nevertheless executed and in the log file the invalid setting isn't visible under the test at all. This isn't great. It would be better if the invalid setting would be visible under the test in the log file and it should also fail the test.\r\n\r\nA similar situation occurs with invalid syntax like `END` or `ELSE` without an opening `IF`. At the moment such invalid syntax is considered to be a keyword. We have `Reserved` library that contains matching keywords, so when these \"keywords\" are run they fail. Invalid syntax reported as failing keywords is odd and the resulting error messages aren't great either. A part of #4210 is detecting this kind of invalid syntax already at the parsing time, but we need to also show them in the log file somehow.\r\n\r\nA solution to both of these error reporting issues is adding new `Error` object to our `TestSuite` structure. When the parser detects invalid syntax, it can create such objects, and when they are run they can simply fail. These errors should create new `<error>` elements to output.xml and they obviously need to be show in log.html as well.\r\n\r\nA problem with this enhancement is that it's not fully backwards compatible:\r\n- Invalid settings like `[Setpu]` don't currently affect test status, but in the future they will fail the test. An obvious solution for this kind of problem is not having such invalid settings in tests in the first place.\r\n- External tools parsing output.xml need to take `<error>` elements into account. In general such tools should ignore elements they don't recognize, but there certainly can be tools that don't behave like that.\r\n- Tools working with the `TestSuite` model need to take new `Error` objects into account.\r\n\r\nInvalid syntax failing a test isn't a big concern for me, but this change possibly breaking external tools is a lot bigger problem. I don't see any other ways this could be handed, though. Doing the change in a non-major version is a bit questionable, but I don't think postponing this change to RF 7 (or changing RF 6.1 to RF 7) is a good idea either. We just need to inform external tool developers about this change in release notes and possibly also otherwise.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4683/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682","id":1620330369,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85glEeB","number":4682,"title":"Make

`FOR IN ZIP` loop behaves like Python's  [zip](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#zip) so that if lists lengths aren't the same, items from the longest one are ignored. For example, the following loop would be executed only twice:\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Variables ***\r\n@{ANIMALS}    dog      cat    horse    cow    elephant\r\n@{ELÄIMET}    koira    kissa\r\n\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    FOR    ${en}    ${fi}    IN ZIP    ${ANIMALS}    ${ELÄIMET}\r\n        Log    ${en} is ${fi} in Finnish\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior can cause problems when iterating over items received from the automated system. For example, the following test would pass regardless how many things `Get something` returns as long as the returned items match the expected values. The example even succeeds if `Get something` nothing.\r\n\r\n```robotframework\r\n*** Test Cases ***\r\nExample\r\n    Validate something    expected 1    expected 2    expected 3\r\n\r\n*** Keywords ****\r\nValidate something\r\n    [Arguments]    @{expected}\r\n    @{actual} =    Get something\r\n    FOR    ${act}    ${exp}    IN ZIP    ${actual}    ${expected}\r\n        Validate one thing    ${act}    ${exp}\r\n    END\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo avoid the above example failing if `Get something` returns more or less values than expected, a separate check needs to be added. Because there's no ready-made keyword for checking are list lengths equal (`Lists should be equal` keyword doesn't work here), the validation needs to use something bit more complicated like this:\r\n```\r\n    Should be equal    ${{len($actual)}}    ${{len($expected)}}\r\n```\r\nFor a real life example see [this example](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/f7ee913622e60c0cf630e1580c2bb58c57100187/atest/robot/running/if/invalid_if.robot#L119) from out acceptance tests. Tests also contain various `FOR IN ZIP` usages where this particular issue could cause problems.\r\n\r\nThis same underlying issues has caused problems with Python's `zip` as well. Starting from Python 3.10 (see [PEP 619](https://peps.python.org/pep-0618/) `zip` has new `strict` parameter that can be used like `zip(actual, expected, strict=True)`. It causes a `ValueError` to be raised if iterated lists have different lengths. Related to this, Python also has separate [itertools.zip_longest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest) that goes through all items in all lists so that if certain list has less value than others, value specified with the `fillvalue` argument is used instead.\r\n\r\nMy proposal is that we add new `mode` configuration option to `FOR IN ZIP` loops. The motivation is that we could have three values `shortest`, `strict` and `longest` emulating Python's behavior with `zip(...)`, `zip(..., strict=True=`), and `zip_longest(...)`, respectively. This was also [considered with Python](https://peps.python.org/pep-0618/#add-several-modes-to-switch-between), but they decided to go with a Boolean option `strict` partly because they already have a separate `zip_longest`.\r\n\r\nAnother reason `mode` wasn't used with Python is that to properly support the `longest` case, it would require adding `fillvalue` that doesn't make sense with other modes. That's a valid concern in our case as well, but I don't consider it too big a problem. We don't at the moment support the `longest` case at all, so this would instead be a nice enhancement and a lot better syntax than separate `FOR IN ZIP LONGEST` would be.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4682/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4680","id":1620223756,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85gkqcM","number":4680,"title":"User

common error when evaluating expressions with IF or otherwise is using something like\r\n```\r\nIF    ${x} == 'expected'\r\n    Keyword\r\nEND\r\n```\r\nwhen the variable `${x}` contains a string. Normal variables are resolved _before_ evaluating the expression, so if `${x}` contains a string `value`, the evaluated expression will be `value == 'expected'`. Evaluating it fails because `value` isn't quoted, it's thus considered a variable in Python, and no such variable exists. The resulting error is this:\r\n\r\n> Evaluating IF condition failed: Evaluating expression 'value == 'expected'' failed: NameError: name 'value' is not defined nor importable as module\r\n\r\nOne solution to this problem is quoting the variable like `'${x}' == 'expected'`, but that doesn't work if the variable value contains quotes or newlines. A better solution is using the special `$var` syntax like `$x == 'value'` that makes the variable available in the Python evaluation namespace (#2040). All this is explained in the [User Guide](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#evaluating-expressions), but there are many users who don't know about this and struggle with the syntax.\r\n\r\nBecause this is a such a common error, we should make the error more informative if the expression contains \"normal\" variables. We could, for example, show also the original expression and recommend quoting or using the \"special\" variable syntax. Possibly it could look like this:\r\n\r\n> Evaluating IF condition failed: Evaluating expression 'value == 'expected'' failed: NameError: name 'value' is not defined nor importable as module\r\n> The original expression was '${x} == 'expected''. Try using the '$var' syntax like '$x == 'expected'' to avoid resolving variables before the expression is evaluated. See the Evaluating expression appendix in the User Guide for more details.\r\n\r\nThere are few problems implementing this:\r\n1. Variables are solved before the [evaluate_expression](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/blob/master/src/robot/variables/evaluation.py#L31) is called so this function doesn't know the original expression nor did it contain variables. This information needs to be passed to it, but in same cases (at least with inline Python evaluation) it isn't that easy.\r\n2. It's not easy to detect when exactly this extra information should be included into the error. Including it always when evaluating the expression fails can add confusion when the error isn't related to variables. It would probably better to include it only if evaluation fails for a NameError, but also in that case you could have an expression like `'${x}' == value` where the variable likely isn't a problem. We could try some heuristics to see what causes the error, but that's probably too much work compared to including the extra info in some cases where it's not needed.\r\n3. Coming up with a good but somewhat short error message isn't easy. I'm not totally happy with the above, but I guess it would be better than nothing.\r\n\r\nBecause this extra info is added only if evaluation fails, this should be a totally backwards compatible change. It would be nice to include it already into RF 6.1, but that release is already about to be late and this isn't that easy to implement, so RF 6.2 is probably a better target. If someone is interested to look at this, including it already into RF 6.1 ought to be possible.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4676/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4676/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4670","id":1609324383,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85f7Fdf","number":4670,"title":"Parsing

Although there isn't yet any visible deprecation warning, the `[Return]` setting is considered deprecated and it will be eventually removed.\r\n\r\nIn the parsing model we currently have a `Return` node refers to the `[Return]` setting while `RETURN` is represented by `ReturnStatement`. It would be better to rename the latter to just `Return` to be consistent with the `Break` and `Continue` nodes as well as with the execution side `Return` object. That would then require renaming the current `Return` to `ReturnSetting` until we can eventually remove it.\r\n\r\nRenaming nodes as discussed above is a backwards incompatible change and needs to wait for RF 7.0. To help with the transition, we can already now in RF 6.1 do some enhancements:\r\n\r\n- Add `ReturnSetting` as an alias for `Return` that tools like RoboTidy can use.\r\n- Enhance `ModelVisitor` so that the `Return` node will match also `visit_ReturnStatement` visitor methods.\r\n- Document that `Return` is deprecated and that `ReturnSetting` should be used instead.\r\n\r\nFirst two items are simple code changes.

we have a keyword like\r\n```\r\ndef kw(arg: Union[T, int]):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nand the type `T` isn't recognized (i.e. doesn't have a converter), the used argument is returned as-is without attempting conversion with remaining types. For example, if we'd use\r\n```\r\nKw    42\r\n```\r\nthe argument value passed to the keyword would be a string and not an integer.\r\n\r\nThis is pretty strange and inconsistent. It would be better to try conversion with all argument types in the order they are specified. If a type has a converter and conversion succeeds, the converted value should be returned.\r\n\r\nIt's a somewhat separate question to decide what to do if conversion doesn't succeed with any converter and there are some unrecognized types. Because we pass values without conversion when using only an unrecognized type like `arg: T`, I believe we should do that also with unions. That way this change would also be mostly backwards incompatible. We can revisit this decision later.\r\n\r\nThis change would be backwards incompatible simply because the argument passed to the keyword in the above example would change. I consider that fine even in a non-major release because the current behavior is, in my opinion, buggy. It's also pretty unlikely tat unrecognized types are used with recognized types like this so there shouldn't be many/any who are actually affected.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4648/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4648/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4647","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4647/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4647/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4647/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4647","id":1573108603,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85dw7t7","number":4647,"title":"Add

This builder only works with suite files and not with resource files. The `LibraryDocumentation` factory method that uses `DocumentationBuilder` handles this problem internally similarly as it handles `DocumentationBuilder` not supporting resource files in PYTHONPATH so this doesn't affect Libdoc itself. It does, however, affect direct usage of `DocumentationBuilder`.\r\n\r\nChanges like this are always annoying, but in this case this isn't too severe because `DocumentationBuilder` isn't really part of the public API and `LibraryDocumentation` should be used instead of it. Alternatively, it's possible to use `ResourceDocBuilder` explicitly when working with resource files. The initial plan was to just document this behavior (#4517), but it is actually easy to fix this by making `DocumentationBuilder` a class instead of a factory method.\r\n\r\nA related problem is that Libdoc's public API isn't properly defined. A separate issue needs to be submitted about that. We can then explicitly recommend `LibraryDocumentation`.\r\n","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4519/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4519/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4516","id":1424167138,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85U4xDi","number":4516,"title":"`Set

Analysis showed that the time was taken by calls to the Built in keyword `Keyword should exist`. In that particular situation it could take more than a second for a single call to `Keyword should exist` to return, with an average of 400ms. Anything above 500ms was causing failures.\r\n\r\nFurther analysis revealed the time to be spend on finding keyword recommendations. Finding these recommendations is a very useful feature when you misspell a keyword during test case development. However, when explicitly checking for a keyword's existence at runtime, the boolean answer suffices. In fact, in the current implementation the recommendations are disposed and not included in the reported failure.\r\n\r\nA proposed solution is available in

New issue (#4454) was submitted about enhancing conflict resolution the problematic regexps explained in the aforementioned comment wouldn't be needed.\r\n\r\nImproved conflict resolution works well and will be part of RF 5.1, but it is still not safe to make custom regexp validation more strict.

A solution to this problem, recommended in the [User Guide](http://robotframework.org/robotframework/latest/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#using-custom-regular-expressions), has been using custom patterns that limit what keywords match. For example, changing the first keyword to `Execute \"${command:[^\"]+}\"` would mitigate the issue.\r\n\r\nIssue #4069 proposes making custom patterns more strict so that they would be validated also when the argument is given as a variable. As the comment referenced above explains, this unfortunately causes problems if patterns have been used for resolving conflicts as explained above.\r\n\r\nA solution to the problem caused by conflicts, that would also allow us making custom pattern validation more strict, would be Robot somehow being able to detect that is the \"best\" match. For a human it is pretty clear that if you use `Execute \"x\" on device \"y\"`, `Execute \"${command}\" on device \"${device}\"` matches better than `Execute \"${command}\"`, but the problem is how Robot can detect that. It's also a question that can it always detect it right or could there be false positives. I have one pretty simple approach in mind that I explain in a separate comment.

For example:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef my_keyword(time: timedelta) -> float:\r\n    return time.total_seconds()\r\n```\r\n\r\nwill fail cleanly during runtime if user tries to pass something incompatible like a list:\r\n\r\n```\r\nValueError: Argument 'time' got value '[1]' (list) that cannot be converted to timedelta.\r\n```\r\ninstead of\r\n```\r\nAttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'total_seconds'\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, this validation only exists for [supported types](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/5.0/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#supported-conversions) and types that has user defined [custom converters](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/5.0/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#custom-argument-converters).\r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\n\r\nAs discussed in issue #3690 backwards compatibility limits us for enabling type guarding on default. One option would be adding a library level toggle but having too many options in `@library` is not desirable either.\r\n\r\nOther option would be adding a special [custom converter](https://robotframework.org/robotframework/5.0/RobotFrameworkUserGuide.html#custom-argument-converters) that only validates that argument [is instance](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#isinstance) of the type. For example like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nROBOT_LIBRARY_CONVERTERS = {\r\n    CustomType1: None,\r\n    CustomType2: None\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `None` would be a shortcut for this pattern:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndef _typechecked(_):\r\n    raise ValueError()\r\n\r\nROBOT_LIBRARY_CONVERTERS = {\r\n    CustomType1: _typechecked,\r\n    CustomType2: _typechecked\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more implementation details see this [comment](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/3690#issuecomment-1220547740).","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4440/reactions","total_count":3,"+1":3,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4440/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4438","id":1341473874,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85P9URS","number":4438,"title":"`Get Time` returns current time if it is given input time that matches epoch","user":{"login":"spu06th","id":19752636,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjE5NzUyNjM2","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/19752636?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th","html_url":"https://github.com/spu06th","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/spu06th/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013645,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDU=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/bug","name":"bug","color":"d73a4a","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":230194541,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMzAxOTQ1NDE=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/beta%202","name":"beta 2","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v6.0","description":"New main release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.

The main reason the singular form has ever been supported than in the early days Robot's data was in HTML tables and tables typically had headers like in this example:\r\n\r\n| Test Case | Keyword | Argument | Argument |\r\n| -- | ------- | ------- | ------- |\r\n| Example | Log | Message |   |\r\n\r\nNowadays there are no concrete benefits in supporting both header formats. There are, however, some drawbacks:\r\n- Supporting multiple formats like this makes the overall syntax a bit more complicated to learn and for external tools to support.\r\n- It makes translation effort (#4390) a bit bigger.\r\n- As pointed out in [this comment](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4390#issuecomment-1213425595) to #4390, some languages support also a [dual form](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_(grammatical_number)) that we should support if we support both singular and plural forms.\r\n\r\nAdding support for the dual form wouldn't be a big task, but it would make the overall syntax even more complicated. A much simpler solution is supporting only the plural form. We can consider the section header like `Test Cases` to indicate that \"below this header we have tests\" and it works fine regardless how many tests there actually are. We have thus made a decision to:\r\n\r\n- support only the plural form with translations (covered by #4390), and\r\n- remove the support for singular form with English.\r\n\r\nWe obviously cannot just remove the support of singular headers in RF 5.1 because the change would be backwards incompatible. These are the steps we are planning to take instead:\r\n\r\n1. Document that singular headers are deprecated in RF 5.1 release notes and in the User Guide. No visible deprecation warning yet. This is covered by this issue.\r\n2. Start emitting deprecation warnings. This can earliest be done in RF 6.0, but we don't have too big hurry and waiting for 7.0 might be better. This is covered by #4432.\r\n3. Actually remove the support for singular headers. This can earliest be the next major release after the one where they are visibly deprecated.","reactions":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4431/reactions","total_count":0,"+1":0,"-1":0,"laugh":0,"hooray":0,"confused":0,"heart":0,"rocket":0,"eyes":0},"timeline_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4431/timeline","performed_via_github_app":null,"state_reason":"completed","score":1},{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429","repository_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429/labels{/name}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429/comments","events_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429/events","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/issues/4429","id":1336868939,"node_id":"I_kwDOAUSaQ85PrwBL","number":4429,"title":"Allow passing flags to regexp related keywords using explicit `flags` argument","user":{"login":"oboehmer","id":22439451,"node_id":"MDQ6VXNlcjIyNDM5NDUx","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/22439451?v=4","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer","html_url":"https://github.com/oboehmer","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/oboehmer/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"labels":[{"id":110013647,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTAwMTM2NDc=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/enhancement","name":"enhancement","color":"a2eeef","default":true,"description":""},{"id":110430378,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwxMTA0MzAzNzg=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/priority:%20medium","name":"priority: medium","color":"238b45","default":false,"description":""},{"id":219378453,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWwyMTkzNzg0NTM=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/beta%201","name":"beta 1","color":"ffffff","default":false,"description":""},{"id":911065884,"node_id":"MDU6TGFiZWw5MTEwNjU4ODQ=","url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/labels/acknowledge","name":"acknowledge","color":"bc82e0","default":false,"description":"To be acknowledged in release notes"}],"state":"closed","locked":false,"assignee":null,"assignees":[],"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61","html_url":"https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework/milestone/61","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/robotframework/robotframework/milestones/61/labels","id":7269150,"node_id":"MI_kwDOAUSaQ84Abuse","number":61,"title":"v6.0","description":"New main release with main focus in improving support for other languages than English.
