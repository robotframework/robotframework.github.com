## Build Setup

``` bash

# clone repo
git clone https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework.github.com.git

# go to sources folder
cd sources

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# and when you are ready to publish your changes, build for production with minification
npm run build

This will generate build files to top-level of project. If you want to contribute and open a pull request, only commit source file changes. The build will be done by maintainer.
```

For a detailed explanation on how things work, check out the [vue-webpack template](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack/) and [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

We also use [bootstrap-vue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/docs) for implementing bootstrap-v4.
