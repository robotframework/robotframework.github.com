        Robot Framework is an open source automation framework for test automation and <a href="https://docs.robotframework.org/docs/getting_started/rpa">robotic process automation (RPA)</a>.
        It is supported by the <a href="/foundation/">Robot Framework Foundation</a> and <a href="/users">widely used</a> in the industry.
        </p>
        <p>
          Its <a href="https://docs.robotframework.org/docs/style_guide">human-friendly and versatile syntax</a> uses keywords and supports <a href="https://docs.robotframework.org/docs/extending_robot_framework/custom-libraries/python_library">extending through libraries</a> in
